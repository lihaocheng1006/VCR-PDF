This report \\nprovides a snapshot of cancer activity in 2022 and \\nexamines trends in cancer diagnoses, deaths, survival, \\nand prevalence since 1982.  \\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains \\nan important issue, as again this year we see fewer \\ndiagnoses than we would have expected to see.  \\nThis expectation is based on historical trends in \\ncancer diagnoses and deaths and considers changes \\nin our Victorian population. It is difficult to determine \\nthe true impact, but based on historical trends \\nbetween 1982-2019, we estimate that there were \\nabout 6,660 fewer diagnoses than expected for the \\nperiod 2020-2022. This excludes prostate cancer,  \\nfor which historical trends make it difficult to \\naccurately assess missed diagnoses. These statistics \\nserve as a salient reminder for Victorians to attend \\ntheir general practitioner if they have health \\nconcerns and for routine health checks. Our statistics \\ndemonstrate that early diagnosis of cancer has  \\na survival benefit.   \\nThe extended impact of COVID-19 makes it \\nincreasingly difficult to project cancer incidence  \\nto 2035. For this reason, we have included two \\nmodels in our estimates. One model is based on \\nhistorical data, excluding 2020-2022 in anticipation \\nof these diagnoses being made in the future.  \\nThe other model includes the recent declines  \\nand projects fewer diagnoses in 2037. Based on \\nthese two models, it is expected that there will be \\nbetween 51,366 and 56,523 new diagnoses reported \\nin the 2033-2037 period. This year, we report blood cancer statistics for the \\nfirst time in detail. Blood cancers constitute 13% \\nof all cancers in Victoria, and while there are more \\nthan 200 sub-categories classified by the World \\nHealth Organization, our focus is on the predominant \\ncategories. For those interested in examining \\nindividual blood cancers not included in this report, \\nalong with other cancers, trends in diagnoses, deaths, \\nand five-year survival spanning four decades, as well \\nas disparities according to location of residence and \\nits associated socioeconomic index, country of birth, \\nAboriginal and T orres Strait Islander heritage, and \\ncancer services, we invite you to visit our website at \\nhttps://www.cancervic.org.au/research/vcr and delve \\ninto our interactive Data Explorer.   \\nThe statistics presented in this report are sourced from \\na comprehensive network, including 262 hospitals, \\n10 radiation therapy centres, BreastScreen Victoria, \\neach of the 26 Victorian pathology providers, and \\nthe 7 interstate cancer registries. T ogether, 217,946 \\ndocuments were processed by the Victorian Cancer \\nRegistry medical coder team to identify the 36,299 \\nnew diagnoses in 2022, and update data from previous \\nyears. The Registry is proud to be among the first in the \\nworld to deliver the 2022 cancer statistics and we’re \\neager to see whether other cancer registries observe  \\nan ongoing impact of COVID-19 on cancer statistics.     \\nThe Victorian Cancer Registry, supported by the \\nVictorian Government\\'s funding, is dedicated \\nto maintaining Victoria\\'s leading position in \\ncomprehensively describing the epidemiology  \\nof cancer. For further information, please contact  \\nus directly via vcr@cancervic.org.au. \\nProfessor Sue Evans  Associate Professor Luc te Marvelde   \\nDirector, Victorian Cancer Registry  Head, Data Analytics\\n8 9GLOSSARY\\nAge-specific rate Provides information on the incidence of a particular event in an age group \\nrelative to the total number of people at risk of that event in the same age \\ngroup. It is calculated by dividing the number of events occurring in each \\nspecified age group by the corresponding ‘at-risk’ population in the same  \\nage group and then multiplying the result by a constant (for example, \\n100,000) to derive the rate. Age-specific rates are expressed per 100,000 \\npopulation in this report.  \\nAge-standardised rate \\n(ASR)Provides the capacity to compare different populations and time periods where \\ndifferent age structures exist.  It is calculated by applying a weighted average \\n(based on a standard population) of the number of new cases or deaths per \\n100,000, with the weights being equal to the proportion of people in each age \\ngroup in a chosen standard population.  \\nCancer incidence Refers to the number of new cancer cases diagnosed during a specific period  \\nin a population. Incidence reflects the number of cancer cases and not the \\nnumber of individuals with cancer; one person may have multiple cancers and \\neach one might be included when calculating cancer incidence, based  \\non internationally agreed rules.\\nCancer mortality The number of deaths attributed to cancer during a specific period in a defined \\npopulation, regardless of when the diagnosis was made. \\nCancer of Unknown \\nPrimary site (CUP)A group of metastatic tumours for which no primary tumour has \\nbeen identified despite a screen of investigations, with specialist \\nreview. The diagnosis usually requires pathology evaluation, including \\nimmunohistochemistry markers to define the tumour cell lineage. This group \\nalso includes patients who present with advanced disease but for whom \\nfurther tests are not done because a definitive diagnosis is not likely to affect \\ntreatment choices or prognosis. Represents less than 1.5% of all cancers \\nreported by the Victorian Cancer Registry.\\nCrude rate (CR) The number of new cancer cases (or deaths) divided by the population at risk  \\nin the specific period, expressed as an annual rate per 100,000 population.  \\nNo age adjustments are made when calculating a crude rate.   \\nCumulative risk An estimate of the total risk that a certain event will happen during a given \\nperiod. This report refers to the cumulative risk of a person being diagnosed \\nwith cancer by the age of 75.  \\nDeath certificate only \\n(DCO%)The proportion of cases registered from a death certificate. \\nFive-year survival Survival in this report refers to ‘relative survival’; the likelihood of a person \\ndiagnosed with cancer surviving for a certain amount of time compared \\nwith similar people in the general population. ‘Similar’ in this case is defined \\nby a person of the same sex, age and year (ie. Survival of a 74 year-old male \\ndiagnosed in 2016 is compared with the life expectancy of all males who turned \\n74 in 2016). A relative five-year survival rate of 100% means that as many \\npeople with cancer will die as those in a similar population without cancer  \\nover a five-year period.   \\nHistology The study of tissues and cells under a microscope. In situ A group of abnormal cells that are found only in the place where they first \\nformed in the body. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread to \\nnearby normal tissue. \\nInternational \\nClassification of Diseases \\nfor Oncology (ICD-O) An international standard for classifying a cancer using a topographical code,  \\nwhich describes the anatomical site of origin (or organ system) of the tumour,  \\nand a morphological code, which describes the cell type (or histology) of the \\ntumour, together with the behaviour (malignant or benign). Medical coders \\nclassify cancers according to the 3rd edition (ICD-O-3).32\\nInternational \\nClassification of Diseases \\nand Related Health \\nProblems (ICD-10)An international standard developed to promote international comparability  \\nin the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of health \\nstatistics.31\\nInvasive cancer Cancer that has spread beyond the layer of tissue in which it developed and  \\nis growing into surrounding, healthy tissues.  \\nMicroscopic verification \\n(MV%)The proportion of cases verified with morphology.\\nMorphology The histological classification of the cancer tissue and a description of the \\ncourse of development that a tumour is likely to take (benign or malignant).  \\nProjection An estimate or forecast of future cancer incidence or mortality based on trends \\nextracted from historical data applied to estimates of future population. Cancer \\nprojection uses an age-period-cohort (APC) model which considers age effects \\n(i.e. biological and social processes linked to ageing), period effects (i.e. external \\neffects impacting all groups) and cohort effects (i.e. the unique exposure/\\nexperience of a group as they move across time).   In this report we project \\ncancer incidence and mortality by sex for the next 15 years. \\nRemoteness Remoteness classification is applied to the patients’ residence at the time \\nof cancer diagnosis. Geographical areas are grouped to major cities, inner-\\nregional, outer-regional and remote Victoria according to the Australian Bureau \\nof Statistics remoteness structure.  \\nRegistry-derived Stage \\n(RD-Stage)The stage of disease at diagnosis, which is derived by registry staff applying \\nrules to data available to a population-based cancer registry. Registry-derived \\nstage has been developed in consultation with clinicians and is intended to \\nbe used for population reporting purposes and not at a patient-level to guide \\nclinical practice.   \\nStandardised Incidence \\nRatio (SIR)/ Standardised \\nmortality ratio (SMR)Used to gain an understanding of whether the number of observed cancer cases \\nin a particular population is higher or lower than expected, given the population \\nand age distribution for that population. It is calculated by dividing the observed \\nnumber of cases by the “expected” number of cases. If more cases are observed \\nthan expected, the SIR is greater than 1. If fewer cases are observed than \\nexpected, the SIR is less than 1. \\nY ears of Potential Life \\nLost (YPLL)The  total number of years of life lost due to a premature death from cancer. In \\nthis report, a premature death is one which occurs before a person reaches 75 \\nyears. For example, someone who died from cancer at the age of 68 equates to \\n7 years of potential life lost.\\n2022 IN NUMBERSMelanoma, prostate, breast, bowel , and lung cancer \\naccount for 56% of all cancer diagnoses in Victoria. \\nThere were over 6,600 fewer cancer diagnoses than \\nexpected between 2020 – 2022.\\nBetween the ages of 15 and 54 years, females are \\nmore likely to be diagnosed with cancer than males, \\nbut more males are diagnosed with cancer overall.\\nMelanoma diagnoses in regional Victoria are 47% \\nhigher than in major cities while head and neck cancer \\ndiagnoses are 33% higher.   \\nOver 350,000 Victorians alive today have been \\ndiagnosed with cancer within the past four decades.\\nAcross all cancers, the 5-year survival rate is 73% for \\nfemales and, for the first time, survival for males has \\nreached 70%.32 people die from cancer every day.   Aboriginal Victorians have a 12% lower five-year \\nsurvival rate at 60% compared to non-Aboriginal \\nVictorians at 72% \\n10 11Werribee, VictoriaCancer is the leading cause of death and a leading \\ncause of disease burden in Victoria. \\nIn 2022, 35,656 Victorians were diagnosed  \\nwith cancer. That’s an average of 98 people \\ndiagnosed every day.   \\nFive-year survival after a diagnosis of leukaemia in \\nchildren aged less than 15 years has improved by 45% \\nover the last 35 years.\\nBlood cancer diagnoses increased by 1% annually \\nuntil 2020, with a consistent 2% annual decline in \\nblood cancer deaths over the past 15 years.  \\n12DEMOGRAPHY\\nJanaya Dwyer, Clinical Nurse Specialist\\n13\\n14 15Snapshot \\n\\t\\x84Victoria’s population is growing and ageing. \\n\\t\\x84Aboriginal Victorians represent 1% of the \\nstate’s population.\\n\\t\\x84About one in three Victorians are born overseas. \\n\\t\\x84Cancer is the cause of death for nearly one in \\nthree Victorians.\\nVictoria’s population is growing \\nVictoria is the second most populous state in Australia \\nafter New South Wales¹, and accounts for one quarter \\nof Australia’s population, but less than 3% of the \\ncountry’s land area. \\nAs at 30 June 2022, there were approximately \\n6,630,258 people living in Victoria, of whom \\n3,277,603 (49.4%) were males and 3,352,655 (50.6%) VICTORIA’S POPULA TION IN 2022\\n1Remoteness areas have been defined by the Australian Statistical Geography Standard using the Accessibility and Remoteness \\nIndex of Australia (ARIA+), which considers road distance from a point to the nearest urban centres and localities.\\nMajor citiesInner regionalOuter regionalRemoteFigure 1: Map of Victoria by Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Remoteness Structure1were females.

In total 36,299 new \\ncancers were registered in 2022, as 643 Victorians had \\nmore than one primary tumour diagnosed.\\nCancer diagnoses declined in 2022 compared  \\nto 2021  \\nTraditionally, the annual number of new cancer \\ndiagnoses has risen in tandem with our expanding \\nand growing population (Figure 4). Between 1990-\\n1994, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer \\nincreased by 3.5% per annum. This was followed by a \\nperiod of stability between 1994-2000 before another \\nperiod of significant increase between 2000-2007 \\n(+1.5% per annum, 95%CI: 0.5%, 2.5%). The past few \\nyears has seen a decline in new diagnoses. Notably, in \\n2020 there was a 3.4% decline in the number of new \\ncancer diagnoses compared to 2019, while in 2021, \\ncancer diagnoses increased by 6.1% compared to \\n2020 but remained below expected levels based on \\npopulation growth and ageing. The age-standardised \\ncancer incidence rate was 322 cases per 100,000 in \\n2019, 303 cases per 100,000 in 2020, and 317 cases \\nper 100,000 in 2021. In 2022, there was a 3.6% decline \\nin the number of new cancer diagnoses compared to \\n2021, with an age-standardised rate of 302 cases per 100,000. Using cancer diagnosis from 1982 to 2019 \\nand considering population trends, it is estimated  that \\nthe number of diagnoses for the period 2020-2022 \\nwas 6,660 (95% CI: -6175, -7145) lower than expected. \\nHowever, the calculations of missed diagnoses exclude \\nestimates related to prostate cancer incidence, given the \\nconsiderable variability in its historical trends.\\nAs of 20 November 2023, no other population-based \\ncancer registries have released 2022 cancer incidence \\ndata. While it is common for population-based cancer \\nregistries to project and estimate incidence rates, \\nuncertainties in certain periods such as the COVID-19 \\nperiod, make accurate projections challenging. \\nTherefore, the significance of the data presented \\nin this report lies in its representation of actual new \\ndiagnoses in 2022. Given that Victoria experienced \\nno restrictions on population movement in 2022, it \\npotentially serves as a valuable benchmark for other \\njurisdictions and countries to use in comparison, \\noffering a reliable reference point in the absence of \\nfinalised data from other registries. \\nThe decline in new cancer diagnoses seen in 2022 \\nmay indicate that there are Victorians living in the \\ncommunity with an undiagnosed cancer which in \\nprevious years would have been reported to the \\nVictorian Cancer Registry by now. The impact of \\nthis will require longer term analyses because many \\ncancers progress slowly and delay may be unlikely to \\nimpact survival for many years and perhaps not at \\nall. Yet, for other aggresive tumours, delay will require \\nmore extensive treatment and may result in higher \\nmortality. An early indication of impact will be seen in \\nmonitoring the stage of cancer with which Victorians \\npresent and compare this with historical data. The \\ndecline in diagnoses may also, in part, reflect deaths \\namong people who would otherwise have been \\ndiagnosed with cancer. In 2021, 0.8% of deaths in \\nAustralia were from COVID-19, rising to 9.6% of \\ndeaths during January and February 2022. \\nCompared to 2021, the age-standardised incidence rate \\nin 2022 declined by 4.7%. The age-standardised rate \\ndeclined in males, from 352 cases per 100,000 in 2021 \\nto 335 cases per 100,000 in 2022. The age-standardised \\nrate declined in females from 287 cases per 100,000 \\nin 2021 to 275 cases per 100,000 in 2022 (Figure 4).  \\nCompared to 2020, there were 809 more diagnoses \\n(+2.3%) in 2022 but considering population growth \\nand the ageing population, there was no significant \\ndifference in the age-standardised rate between 2020 \\nand 2022.

For bowel  \\ncancer diagnoses in males, 19% occur in those  \\naged  60-74 years, and for melanoma in males,  \\n39% of cases are in 60-74 age group. The age-specific \\nincidence rate of lung cancer almost doubled in males aged 60-64, compared to those aged 55-59 years, from 62.4 to 106.9 cases per 100,000 (or from 116  \\nto 189 cases in 2022). Lung cancer rates continue  \\nto rise to a rate of 216.2 cases per 100,000 in males aged 70-74 years and to 376.9 cases per 100,000  \\nin males aged 80-84 years.   \\nIn females diagnosed with cancer and aged 60-74 \\nyears, breast cancer constitutes 29%, followed by  \\nlung cancer at 11%, bowel cancer at 9%, and melanoma at 7%. \\nAmong females diagnosed with breast cancer, 36% \\nare in females aged 60 to 74 years. For lung cancer diagnoses in females, 21% occur in those aged between 60-74 years. For bowel cancer diagnoses in females, 15% occur in those aged  60-74 years, and for melanoma in females, 14% of cases are in 60-74 age group. Lung cancer rates are lower in females than for males, but this gap is narrowing (Figure 19).    Projecting cancer diagnoses is more difficult  \\nas a result of the COVID-19 years. \\nCancers are projected to increase, because Victorians \\nare living longer, and cancer is generally a disease of older people. Projections are also influenced by previous improvement in early detection, treatment, and survivorship, which has resulted from scientific discovery. Finally, projections are influenced by population growth, or the movement of people into and out of Victoria. An unknown variable in determining projections is the impact of COVID-19, which has had an immediate and acute impact on cancer diagnoses. It will take some time to understand the impact of the rapid decline in cancer diagnoses, and population-based cancer registries will monitor this through incidence data, including stage of disease at diagnosis, and mortality data. T wo models have been used to project new diagnoses in this report:\\n– Model 1 considers that trends will change as a result\\nof the previous three years (COVID-19 period), and\\n– Model 2 has removed this period from analyses.Details are provided in T able 2 for both Model 1  \\nand 2, with the estimated number of new diagnoses in \\nthe period 2033-2037 ranging from 51,366 (95%CI: 49,889-53,023) to 56,523 (95%CI: 54,013-59,420). Details of how projections are calculated  \\nare outlined in Appendix 2.\\nThe number of new cancer diagnoses are \\nprojected to increase for almost all cancers  \\nover the next 15 years.  \\nThe increase in the absolute numbers of new \\ndiagnoses in the next 15 years depends on whether the 2020-2022 years, for which the number of new diagnoses is down compared to predicted cases using pre-COVID data, are included. Including 2020-2022 (model 1), diagnoses are estimated to increase by 48% in males and by 38% among females. These numbers assume that the downward trends in 2020-2022 will continue into the future. Excluding 2020-2022 (model 2), diagnoses are estimated to increase by 55% in males and by 57% among females. These numbers assume the missed diagnoses will present in the future (T able 2).  \\n26 27\\nAboriginal and T orres Strait \\nIslander People*\\nCancer disproportionately affects Aboriginal \\nVictorians. In an effort to tackle this inequality, the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (VACCHO) has collaborated with various entities, including the Victorian Integrated Cancer Services, the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre Alliance, health services, and Regional Cancer Centres. T ogether, they have formulated the Victorian Aboriginal Cancer Journey Strategy, aiming to enhance cancer outcomes \\n(15). The strategy is \\ncentered on self-determination, ensuring the delivery of high quality care in a manner that aligns with the cultural needs of Aboriginal Victorians. The Optimal Care Pathway for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES \\nAMONG VICTORIANS\\nPeople with cancer, (16) provides a guiding framework \\nto assess the quality of care delivered to Aboriginal \\nVictorians diagnosed with cancer.   \\nAboriginal Victorians are twice as likely  \\nto be diagnosed with cancer than non-\\nAboriginal Victorians.   \\nIn the period 2017-2021, on average 328 cancers \\nwere diagnosed in Aboriginal Victorians each year,  \\n172 in males and 156 in females. The age-standardised incidence rate of cancer among Aboriginal males was 736 cases per 100,000 and among Aboriginal females was 581 cases per 100,000. By comparison, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer among non-Aboriginal Victorian males was 354 cases per 100,000 and among non-Aboriginal females was 284 cases per 100,000 (Figure 10).  \\nAboriginal Victorian males are more than twice as \\nlikely to be diagnosed with cancers of the liver, lung, and head and neck. Aboriginal Victorian females  \\nare more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancers of the liver, lung, head and neck, lymphoma and leukaemia.     \\nThe most common cancers for Aboriginal Victorians \\nto be diagnosed with are lung, prostate, breast and bowel cancers.

Between 2020-2022, there were approximately 6,212 males and 4,657 females living in regional Victoria diagnosed with cancer each year. Age-standardised rates of those living in regional Victoria are higher among males than females (371 NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES \\nAMONG VICTORIANS\\nversus 295 cases per 100,000) (Figure 12). Both males \\nand females living in regional Victoria have higher age-standardised rates of cancer than those residing in major Victorian cities.   \\nThe most common cancers among regional Victorians \\nare the same as urban Victorians: prostate, breast, bowel, lung and melanoma. Y et, age-standardised rates were significantly higher for both males and females residing in regional Victoria diagnosed with melanoma, leukaemia, bowel and lung cancer.

Some details of commonly diagnosed cancers are described in this section. \\nProstate cancer \\nIncidence and trend: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 16% of all cancers diagnosed in Victoria in 2022 and 29% of all cancers diagnosed in males. In 2022, there were 5,823 males diagnosed with prostate cancer, providing an age-standardised incidence rate of 98 new cases per 100,000 population. The median age at diagnosis is 69 years (IQR: 63-75) with a range from 33 to 102 years. Prostate cancer rates have fluctuated more than any other cancer in Victoria over the past three decades, with incidence rates mirroring trends in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test rates and shown in Figure 16A. \\nImpact of COVID-19: In 2022, the observed new \\ndiagnoses exhibited a relative difference of -22% (95%CI: -18%, -26%) compared to the expected number of cases based on data from 2014-2019, translating to 1,622 fewer cases than anticipated. The decline was most pronounced in males aged 65-69 years (-21%, 95%CI: -13%, -29%) and 75-79 years (-25% [95%CI: -15%, -34%).   \\nProjections: Fluctuations in historical incidence rates \\nmake it very difficult to predict future rates (T able 2). \\nConsidering these uncertainties, it is projected that annual incidence in 2033-2037 will range from 8,002 to 9,866 or an age-standardised rate range from 102 to 118 cases per 100,000 males (T able 2).         \\nStage at diagnosis: The International Society of \\nUrological Pathology (ISUP) grade group is used to indicate the histological patterns of prostate cancer based on the Gleason score, providing a standardised approach to assessing the aggressiveness of the cancer. A lower ISUP grade confers a survival advantage over higher ISUP grade groups. In Victoria in 2022, 26% of prostate cancer is diagnosed at ISUP grade group 1, 28% at ISUP grade group 2, 13% at ISUP grade group 3, 5% at ISUP grade group 4 and 13% at ISUP grade group 5. In 2022, 350 males (6%) were diagnosed with metastatic disease and for 464 males (8%) the grade group was unknown. Trend in ISUP grade group classification since 2010 is shown in Figure 16B.  NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES \\nAMONG VICTORIANS\\nBreast cancer  \\nIncidence and trend: Breast cancer is the second \\nmost common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 13% of all new cases diagnosed in 2022, 29% of all cancers diagnosed in females and 0.2% of cancers among males. There were 4,805 females and 45 males diagnosed in 2022, providing an age-standardised incidence rate of 89 new cases per 100,000 among females and 0.6 cases per 100,000 among males. The median age at diagnosis for females is 62 years (IQR: 51-73 ) and for males is 78 years (IQR: 67-83). Trends in age-standardised rates of breast cancer among females between 1982-2022 is shown in Figure 17A. \\nImpact of COVID-19: In 2022, there were 472 (95%CI: \\n-358, -585) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of breast cancer. The decline in new diagnoses relative to expected  in 2022 of 9% (95%CI: -6.8%, -11.1%) is more pronounced than in 2021 (-3.8%, 95%CI: -1.9%, -5.8%) but less than experienced in 2020 (-12.4%, 95%CI: -10.7%, -14.2%), when comparedFigure 16: Prostate cancer trend in (A) incidence, 1982-2022 with projections to 2037 based on two models described in Appendix 2 Statistical Methodology and B) ISUP grade group at diagnosis, 2010-2022, Victoria.

The decline was most pronounced in females aged 70-74 years (-19.5%, 95%CI: -12.9%, -26%). The cumulative deficit in breast cancer diagnoses for the period 2020-2022 is estimated to be 1,206 cases, reflecting a 7.9% decline.\\nProjections: In the next decade to 2033-2037, \\nbreast cancer age-standardised rates are anticipated to remain steady if COVID-impacted years are removed from the projection model (Model 2) or decline slightly if COVID-19 years are included in the model (Model 1) (Figure 17A). The actual number of breast cancer diagnoses in females is likely to increase to between 6,206-7,297 cases annually over the next 15 years  (T able 2). \\nStage at diagnosis: Trend in registry-derived \\nstage of disease at diagnosis for the period 2010-2022 is shown in Figure 17B. Stage is calculated using registry-derived stage, with the methodology discussed in Appendix 2. Early-stage breast cancer is stage 1 or 2 and indicates that the cancer is contained in the breast or that growth has only extended to the nearby lymph nodes. Stage 3 breast cancer indicates that the tumour is locally advanced, it is larger than 5cm and has spread to tissues around the breast such as the skin, muscles or ribs, or has spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 4 breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body and is called advanced or metastatic disease. In 2022, 38% of breast cancer is diagnosed at stage 1, 37% at stage 2, 7% at Stage 3, 4% at stage 4, and for 14% of cases, stage could not be calculated.   \\nBowel cancer  \\nIncidence and trend: Bowel, or colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 10% of all new cases diagnosed in both males and females in 2022. There were 3,504 new bowel cancer diagnoses in 2022: 1,814 (52%) in males and 1,690 (48%) in females, providing an age-standardised incidence rate of 31.0 new cases per 100,000 among males and 24.9 cases per 100,000 among females.  \\nThe median age at diagnosis is 70 years (IQR: 58-80), with a slightly younger median age at diagnosis for males compared to females (69 [IQR: 58-78] vs 72 [IQR: 59-81] years respectively). Between 2012-2022, the age-standardised incidence rate for all ages decreased from 34.7 to 27.8 cases per 100,000 people (Figure 18A). For the period 2001-2019 the annual percent change in bowel cancer diagnoses was -1.6% (95%CI: -1.8%, -1.3%) in males. Among females, there has been a modest annual percent decline between 1992-2017 of 0.7% (95%CI: -0.9%, -0.5%). \\nImpact of COVID-19: In 2022, there were 614 (95%CI: \\n-537, -691) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of bowel cancer.

The decline was seen equally among males and females. In total, in the period 2020-2022 there was an 11.9% (95%CI: -9.6%, -14.3%) decline in new bowel cancer diagnoses among males and an 11.1% (95%CI: -8.5%, -13.7%) decline in new diagnoses in females compared to the number of expected cases based on trends in the 2001-2019 period. The overall deficit of 1,399 fewer cases than expected, reflects an 11.5% decline across both males and females in the period 2020-2022 compared with historical trends between 2001-2019.\\nProjections: Bowel cancer rates are anticipated  \\nto increase over the next decade (T able 2 and Figure \\n18A). Cases are projected to increase to 32.3 cases per 100,000 (Model 1) or 38.9 cases per 100,000 (Model 2). The number of bowel cancer diagnoses  \\nis projected to be between 4,567 - 5,757 cases annually over the next 15 years.\\nStage at diagnosis: Bowel cancer stage at registry-\\nderived diagnosis is reasonably evenly distributed across the four groups, as seen in Figure 18B. In 2022, 21% of bowel cancer cases were diagnosed with stage 1 disease, 21% with stage 2 disease, 19% with stage 3 disease, 19% with stage 4 disease and for 21% of cases stage could not be derived. Comparing the distribution of bowel cancer diagnoses in 2022 and 2010, there is a 10% increase in the proportion  \\nof  cases diagnosed with stage 1 disease , a 3% decline in cases diagnosed with stage 2 disease,  \\na 14% increase in the cases diagnosed with stage 4 disease, and a 7% decline in cases with no stage \\navailable over the last 12 years.NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES \\nAMONG VICTORIANS\\nFigure 18:  Tren d in bowel cance r (A) incidence , 1982-\\n2022 with projections to 2037 based on two mode ls \\ndescribed in Appendix 2 Statisti cal Methodolog y  \\nand B) registry- derived stage at diagnosis, 201 0-\\n2022, Vict oria .  \\nLung cancer  \\nIncidence and trend: Lung cancer is the fourth  most \\ncommon cancer in Victoria, accounting for 9% of \\nall new cases diagnosed in 2022 among both males \\nand females.

The overall deficit of 890 fewer cases than expected, reflects an 8.4% decline across both males and females in the period 2020-2022 compared with historical trends between 2015-2019.\\nProjections: Long-term trends show a plateauing of \\nlung cancer incidence among both males and females (Figure 19). In the period 2033-2037, lung cancer cases are projected to remain steady at 24.9 cases per 100,000 (Model 1) or increase to 26.1 cases per 100,000 (Model 2) (T able 2).  \\n1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 2032Age-standardised rate\\n01020304050Male\\nFemaleObserved\\nProjected - Model 1\\nProjected - Model 2\\n1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 2032Age-standardised rate\\n01020304050\\nMale\\nFemaleObservedProjected - Model 1\\nProjected - Model 2A\\n01020304050607080\\n2010 2014 2018 2022% of tumours diagnosedStage at diagnosis\\n1\\n234UnknownBowel\\nB\\nMelanoma  \\nIncidence and trend: Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in Victoria. In 2022, 2,885 Victorians were diagnosed with melanoma (1,697 males and 1,188 females), accounting for 8% of all new cases diagnosed in 2022 (8.6% of all cancers diagnosed in males and 7.2% in females). The age-standardised incidence rate was 29 cases per 100,000 among males and 19 cases per 100,000 among females. The median age at diagnosis is 69 years (IQR: 58-77). Between 1996-2018, there has been no annual percent change in new melanoma diagnoses. An annual percent decline of 4.2%  was seen between 2018-2022, incorporating the COVID-19 years. The trend in melanoma incidence is outlined in Figure 20A. “If this was 20 years ago, Isla would’ve  \\ndied. The research that’s been done  \\nin that time means that we could  \\ngo through without those thoughts. ”  \\nIsla was diagnosed with leukaemia when she \\nwas three years old. The first visible sign that \\nsomething was wrong was the appearance of a small lump on her head that progressively grew. \\n“After about three months of going around in \\ncircles, we decided to go straight to emergency \\nto see if we could get some answers, ” says, Pam. \\n“Within about an hour or so we found out that \\nshe had leukaemia. So, from there we were straight up to the ward and that’s when the \\njourney started for us. ” \\nIsla was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic \\nleukaemia (ALL), which affects around 121 \\nVictorians each year, including 65 children under \\n15 years.  \\nAfter months of uncertainty, Pam was relieved \\nto finally have a diagnosis. “I just remember that feeling of ‘now it starts, now we do what we need to do to get through it, ’” she said. \\nIsla was placed on a course of steroids, \\nchemotherapy, and antibiotics, taking as many as 20 pills a day. She would also go to hospital \\nfor intravenous chemotherapy and lumbar \\npunctures and stay for lengthy periods. \\nT wo-and-a-half years after her diagnosis, \\nincluding nine months of intensive treatment, the medical staff rang the bell at the conclusion \\nof Isla’s final dose of chemotherapy. But for Pam and Gareth, there is still an anxious two-year \\nwindow where relapse is possible. \\n“It’s not done, not in my brain. I’ve still got \\nanother 18 months before it’s done. So, it’s always sitting back there, ” said Pam.

Uterine age-standardised rates are estimated to range from between 16.4 to 17.7 cases per 100,000 in 2033-2037, while new diagnoses are expected to increase by between 36-46% over the next decade, depending on whether or not COVID-19 period is included in projection models.   \\nStage of disease at diagnosis: Registry-derived \\nstage was developed for endometrial cancer, excluding other sub-categories of uterine cancers because of differing definitions and survival rates between endometrial and non-endometrial malignancies of the uterus. For endometrial cases diagnosed in 2022, 4% were unstageable. Therefore, of those with stage reported,  77% were diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 disease, 15% with stage 3 disease and 8% with stage 4 disease (Figure 21B).NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES \\nAMONG VICTORIANS\\nFigure 21: Trend in (A) uterine incidence, 1982-\\n2022 with projections to 2037 based on two models described in Appendix 2 Statistical Methodology and B) endometrial cancer registry-derived stage groupat diagnosis, Victoria 2018-2022 \\n1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 2032Age-standardised rate\\n051015\\nObserved\\nProjected - Model 1\\nProjected - Model 2A\\n01020304050607080\\n2010 2014 2018 2022% of tumours diagnosedStage at diagnosis\\n1\\n234UnknownEndometrial cancer\\nBFigure 20:  Trend in melanoma (A) incidence, 1982-2022 with projections to 2037 based on two models described in Appendix 2 Statistical Methodology and B) registry-derived stage group at diagnosis, 2018-2022, Victoria.\\nImpact of COVID-19. In 2022, there were 413 (95%CI: -347, -478) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of melanoma. The decline in new diagnoses relative to expected in 2022 of 12.5% (95%CI: -10.5%, -14.5%) is similar to 2021 (-11.4%, 95%CI: -9.5%, -13.3%) but less pronounced than reported in 2020 (-17.0%, 95%CI: -15.3%, -18.8%). There was a similar decline among males and females. In total, in the period 2020-2022 there was a 13.2% (95%CI: -10.7%, -15.7%) decline in new melanoma diagnoses among males and a 14.2% (95%CI: 11.4%, -17.0%) decline in new diagnoses in females compared to expected numbers based on trends in the 1996-2019 period. The overall deficit of 1,311 fewer cases than expected, reflects an13.6% decline across both males and females in the period 2020-2022 compared with historical trends between1996-2019. \\nProjections: Melanoma age-standardised incidence \\nrates are projected to continue to decline for both \\nmales and females over the next 15 years (Figure 20A).

For 3% of cases, the stage at diagnosis was unable to be derived or captured from hospital notifications. Over the past five years, there has been a slight decline in the percent of cases diagnosed annually with stage 1 disease (75% to 71%) while the number of cases diagnosed with stage 2 disease has increased from 14% to 21% (Figure 20B).   \\n1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 2032Age-standardised rate\\n05101520253035\\nMale\\nFemaleObservedProjected - Model 1\\nProjected - Model 2A\\n01020304050607080\\n2010 2014 2018 2022% of tumours diagnosedStage at diagnosis\\n1\\n234UnknownMelanoma\\nB\\nUterine (endometrial) cancer \\nIncidence and trend: Uterine cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer among Victorian females and the 5th most commonly diagnosed tumour in females in 2022.

In 2022, COVID-19 accounted  \\nfor 2,955 deaths among Victorians.17    \\nY ears of potential life lost – a measurement of \\npremature death – is calculated by subtracting the \\nage at a person’s death from that of a ‘standard life’ , \\nwhich is calculated as being 75 years by the Australian \\nBureau of Statistics.18 Victorian Cancer Registry data \\nestimates that cancer will account for 63,628 years  \\nof life lost prematurely in 2022.   \\n32 people die from cancer every day.  \\nIn 2022, 11,829 Victorians died from cancer, including \\n6,576 males and 5,253 females.  \\nMore males die from cancer than females.  \\nMales account for 56% of cancer-related deaths.  \\nFor cancers common in both males and females (and \\nexcluding breast cancer), males account for 59% of \\ndeaths. In 2022, the median age at death following  \\na diagnosis of cancer was 76 years (IQR: 67-84).  \\nThe number of cancer-related deaths is increasing \\nin Victoria due to a growing and ageing population. \\nHowever, as an age-standardised rate, cancer-related \\ndeaths are declining (Figure 22).For males, the age-standardised mortality rate has \\ndeclined at a steady annual rate of 0.5% between \\n1982-1995 and at a more rapid annual rate of 2.2% \\nbetween 1995-2022. The age-standardised mortality \\nrate has declined from 169 deaths per 100,000 in \\n1982, to 138 deaths per 100,000 in 2002, to 110 \\ndeaths per 100,000 in 2012 to 90 deaths per 100,000 \\nreported in 2022.     \\nFor females, the age-standardised mortality rate \\nhas also declined over the past four decades but at a \\nmore modest rate and from a lower baseline. Between \\n1982-1993, an average annual percent change \\nof -0.1% was reported. Between 1993-2022, the \\naverage annual decline increased to 1.6%. The age-\\nstandardised mortality rate has declined from 106 \\ndeaths per 100,000 in 1982, to 93 deaths per 100,000 \\nin 2002, to 77 deaths per 100,000 in 2012 and to 65 \\ndeaths per 100,000 in 2022.  \\nThe declining mortality rate is the result of \\nimprovements in cancer prevention, diagnosis, \\nand treatment. This includes improved recognition \\nof symptoms prompting diagnosis, increasing \\navailability and uptake of screening and case-\\nfinding, improvement in delivery of health services, \\nand discoveries such as targeted drug therapies.  \\nThe mortality rate of most cancers is projected to \\ndecline over the next 15 years. \\nOver the next 15 years, it is projected that male \\ncancer mortality rates will continue to decline, with \\nthe two projection models demonstrating little \\nimpact of deaths in 2033-2037 (T able 4). Uterine \\ncancers age-standardised deaths are predicted to \\nincrease from 2.2 to between 2.4 and 3.2 deaths per \\n100,000 population by 2033-2037.

Mortality from cervical cancer, one of the few \\nhighly preventable cancers, is 7.3 times higher among \\nAboriginal Victorian females than non-Aboriginal \\nfemales (SIR: 733, ASR 6.4 [95%CI: 2.6, 13.7] vs 0.9 \\n[95%CI: 0.8, 1.0]). With the introduction of universal \\nself-collection for cervical screening, Aboriginal \\nwomen and people with a cervix have increasingly \\nparticipated in cervical screening, including those that \\nare underscreened. \\n *Aboriginal Victorians in this report refers to Aboriginal and/or T orres Strait islander peoples in VictoriaThe median age at death for an Aboriginal \\nVictorian diagnosed with cancer is 67 years \\ncompared to 76 years among non-Aboriginal \\nVictorians. \\nThere is a nine-year difference in median age at death \\nbetween Aboriginal Victorians and non-Aboriginal \\nVictorians.

The Beautiful Shawl Project is a joint effort led by the Community, aiming to offer secure and empowering \\nbreast screening encounters for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women. It presents a culturally \\nsensitive and responsive alternative for conventional screening. The initiative involves supplying \\npersonalised screening shawls to Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women, designed to be culturally \\nfitting, recognisable, and aesthetically pleasing to wear during their breast screening. These shawls,  \\ncrafted by talented local Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women and artists, are given as gifts  \\nto take home following the screening process.

In 2022, 1,252 males and 953 \\nfemales died from lung cancer, accounting for \\n19% of all cancer-related deaths. The median age \\nat death was 75 years (IQR: 67-82). In 2022, the \\nage-standardised mortality rate was 17.6 deaths \\nper 100,000 males and 11.6 deaths per 100,000 \\nfemales (Figure 32). Among males, lung cancer age-\\nstandardised mortality rates declined at an annual \\npercent change of 0.7% during the period 1982-\\n1989 and then a more rapid annual decline of 2.9% \\nwas seen between 1989-2022. Among females there \\nwas a steady annual increase in mortality of 1.9% \\nbetween 1982-1994, after which a modest annual \\ndecline in age-standardised mortality was seen of \\n0.2% between 1994-2015. Over the past eight years \\n(2015-2023), the annual percent decline in mortality \\nrates among females has accelerated to 2.3%. This \\nvariation is likely the result of historical differences \\nin smoking behavior, with smoking rates in men \\ndecreasing since the 1960s but rates in females not \\ndecreasing until the 1970s.20     \\nProjections: Data released by the Australian \\nInstitute of Health and Welfare indicates that 11.2% Figure 31: Age-specific cancer mortality rates  \\n(with 95% confidence intervals) by sex for regional \\nand non-regional Victorians, 2020- 2022 Figure 32: Lung cancer trend in age standardised \\nmortality rate, 1982-2022 with projections to \\n2037 based on two models described in Appendix 2 \\nStatistical Methodology. \\n0500100015002000\\n0-14 15-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 75+Age-specific rate (per 100,000)Males - Rest of Victoria\\nMales - Major cities\\nFemales - Rest of Victoria\\nFemales - Major citiesof Australians aged 15 years and over reported daily \\nsmoking in 2019.21 The proportion of Australians \\nwho self-report never smoking has increased by \\n14% between 1991and 2019 from 49% to 63% \\nand is currently at its highest level seen over this \\n25-year period.

Among females, the decline \\nin bowel cancer mortality has been occurring at a \\nsteady rate of 2.3% annually since 1982. The overall \\ndecline in bowel cancer age-standardised mortality \\nrates seen in Victoria is likely the result of changing \\npatterns in bowel cancer risk factors, improvements in \\ncancer treatment, and opportunistic colorectal cancer \\nscreening since the 1990s, as well as a phased rollout \\nof the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program from \\n2006.22   \\nProjections: The number of Victorians dying from \\nbowel cancer is expected to increase over the next \\n15 years, yet age-standardised mortality rates are \\nexpected to decline or remain constant over this \\nperiod (T able 4).

In \\n2022, 917 Victorians died from pancreatic cancer – \\n475 males and 442 females, accounting for 8% of all \\ncancer-related deaths. In 2022, the age-standardised \\nmortality rate was 6.6 deaths per 100,000 males and \\n5.2 deaths per 100,000 females (Figure 34). Despite \\nthe relatively low number of cases diagnosed each \\nyear, it is the fifth leading cause of potential years of \\nlife lost, after lung, bowel, breast, brain and central \\nnervous system cancer. Because of its poor prognosis, \\nnearly the same number of people die from pancreatic \\ncancer as are diagnosed with the disease. The high \\nmortality rate of pancreatic cancer is the result of the \\ndisease only manifesting in its late stage. Currently, \\nno screening test exists to detect the cancer before \\nsymptoms develop. For the period 1982-2022, age-\\nstandardised mortality rates have been declining \\nsteadily at an average annual percent of 0.3% among \\nmales and increasing steadily at an average annual \\nrate of 0.2% in females.   \\nProjections: Pancreatic cancer deaths are expected \\nto remain constant at an age-standardised rate of \\nbetween 5.3 and 5.6 deaths per 100,000 in the next \\n15 years (T able 4).    \\n1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 2032Age-standardised rate\\n02468\\nMale\\nFemale\\nObserved\\nProjected - Model 1\\nProjected - Model 2Breast cancer  \\nMortality and trend: Breast cancer is the second \\nleading cause of cancer deaths in females.

In 2022, the \\nage standardised mortality rate was 9.6 deaths per \\n100,000 males (Figure 36). Among males, prostate \\ncancer age-standardised mortality rates have \\nfluctuated over the past four decades. Prostate cancer \\nage-standardised mortality rates increased between \\n1982-1994 at an average percent change of 1.9%. \\nThis was followed by a period of decline in deaths, \\nfrom 1994–2010 at an average rate of 2.1% and then \\nmore rapidly between 2010–2014 at 7.2%. Over the \\npast 8 years (2014–2022), prostate cancer deaths \\nhave declined at a steady annual rate of 1.1%.

Furthermore, the \\nworkforce strategy champions the principles of self-\\ndetermination, empowering Aboriginal people to \\nown their health and wellbeing and devise targeted, \\nlocalised solutions to workforce planning. By fostering \\na sense of safety and support within health services, \\nthese principles are anticipated to enhance cancer \\noutcomes for Aboriginal individuals.\\nFigure 41 demonstrates that five-year survival \\nfollowing a diagnosis of bowel cancer is significantly \\nworse for Aboriginal Victorians compared with \\nnon-Aboriginal Victorians.

Eventually some of \\nthese cutting-edge treatments could become \\nstandard of care. ”  PREVALENCE\\nA snapshot of cancer prevalence  \\nin Victoria in 2022 \\n\\t\\x84An estimated 129,454 Victorians are alive after \\na cancer diagnosis in the past five years, and \\n211,930 Victorians are alive after a cancer \\ndiagnosis in the past 10 years. \\n\\t\\x84Over 350,000 Victorians who are alive today, \\nhave been diagnosed with cancer in the last \\nfour decades. \\n\\t\\x84The proportion of Victorians alive after a cancer \\ndiagnosis in the previous 5 years has more than \\ndoubled in the last 35 years. \\n\\t\\x84The most prevalent cancer for Victorian men \\naged 50 and over is prostate cancer.  \\n\\t\\x84The most prevalent cancer for Victorian women \\naged 50 and over is breast cancer.  \\nCancer prevalence measures the number of people \\nliving with cancer (including in remission). It is \\ncalculated by assessing the number of people alive  on a certain date (index date) and diagnosed with \\ncancer within a specified previous number of years.  \\nCancer prevalence reflects the relationship between \\ncancer incidence and survival and is impacted by \\nthe stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis and the \\neffectiveness of available treatments. \\nThe impact of cancer extends well beyond the \\ndiagnostic and treatment period. Sequalae of a cancer \\ndiagnosis include physical consequences of treatments \\n(e.g. pain, loss of function peripheral neuropathy, \\nlymphoedema, metabolic syndrome), psychosocial \\nimpact (e.g. anxiety and depression, cancer-related \\nfatigue, fear of recurrence, altered sleep and cognition, \\neffects on sex and intimacy) and may include financial \\nissues – all of which are likely to impact on quality of life \\nin the medium and longer term.30 Trends in prevalence \\ntherefore enables forecasting of healthcare costs and \\nservices to ensure that the complex needs of Victorian \\ncancer survivors are met.

The International Statistical \\nClassification of Diseases and Related Problems-\\n10th edition Australian modified edition (ICD-\\n10AM)31 classifies blood cancers in such a way \\nthat diverse morphologies are amalgamated \\nwithin the classification, leading to the grouping \\nof heterogeneous blood cancers under a single \\ncategory. This section applies morphology codes \\nfrom the International Classification of Diseases for \\nOncology-3rd edition,32 to the ICD-10AM codes to \\nallow a more nuanced understanding and reporting \\nof blood cancers. This approach has recently been \\nused in the reporting of blood cancer incidence and \\nsurvival by the Australian Institute of Health and \\nWelfare (AIHW).34 A summary of acronyms used in \\nthis report is shown in T able 5. \\nAcronym Description Acronym Description\\nALL Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia AML Acute myeloid leukaemia\\nCLL Chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia CML Chronic myeloid leukaemia\\nDLBCL Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma FL Follicular lymphoma\\nHL Hodgkin lymphoma MDS Myelodysplastic syndromes\\nMPN Myeloproliferative neoplasms MM Multiple myeloma\\nNHL Non-Hodgkin lymphoma PCM Plasma cell myelomaAbout 1 in 8 cancers are blood cancers  \\nIn 2022, 4,566 Victorians were diagnosed with blood \\ncancers, at an age-standardised incidence rate of 38 \\ncases per 100,000.

So, when you do find \\nsomething really exciting, it can be \\nreally rewarding to see that. ”\\nDr Omer Gilan and his team are “looking under \\nthe hood” of leukaemia cells by exploring the \\nepigenetic landscape to develop new targeted \\ntherapy options for leukaemia patients.    \\nStudying why cancer cells are able to “hijack \\nthe epigenome to drive the formation of \\ncancer” , he and his team are looking at ways \\nto exploit this knowledge to target cancer cells \\nmore effectively and predict how cells become \\nresistant to therapy. \\n“Only recently we discovered there’s this protein, \\ncalled ‘menin’ , that is needed by a very aggressive \\ntype of leukaemia. It was just by tinkering with \\nthe cells and understanding how they are kept \\nalive that this therapy, called a ‘menin inhibitor’ , \\nwas able to be developed” says Dr Gilan. \\nBy temporarily switching off menin, the team has \\nfound that the leukaemia cells stop proliferating. \\nEarly tests have indicated that not only does this \\ntherapy take the “foot of the accelerator” , “it’s \\nalso hitting the brakes on the [cancer] cells and \\nfrom which they cannot recover” . \\n“This therapy restores the normal trajectory of \\nthe cells. By restoring that normal trajectory \\nyou’re basically eliminating the leukaemia \\ncells by sending them back to what they were \\nsupposed to be doing, ” says Dr Gilan. \\nT argeting menin effectively kills aggressive \\nleukaemia cells, prompting therapies that \\nare currently in clinical trials. By interrogating \\nepigenetic proteins that may cooperate with \\nmenin to prevent drug resistance, Dr Gilan is \\ndiscovering new ways of treating patients with \\naggressive leukaemia.

In total, 0.7% of the Victorian \\npopulation have been diagnosed with a blood cancer \\nin the last 40 years (from 1 January 1983) and were \\nalive on 1 January 2023.  Commonly Diagnosed Blood Cancers\\n1. Myeloid Blood Cancers\\nMyeloid blood cancers affect cells in the bone marrow \\nand blood. They originate in the myeloid cells, which \\nare responsible for producing granulocytic and related \\ncells. The main myeloid blood cancers include AML, \\nMDS, and MPNs, including CML. Myeloid cancers \\naccount for 28% of all blood cancers.  \\nAcute Myeloid leukaemia (AML) \\nAML is an aggressive cancer that resemble immature \\nmyeloid cells in the bone marrow, disrupting the \\nproduction of normal bone marrow, which normally \\ngenerates red blood cells, platelets, and normal \\nwhite blood cells that circulate in the peripheral \\nblood. Patients affected with AML have severely \\nsuppressed red blood cells, platelets, and white blood \\ncells (neutrophils) in the peripheral blood. The last \\nfew years have seen major breakthroughs in how \\nthe disease is understood and managed. There \\nare multiple distinct subtypes of AML categorised \\naccording to their morphology, immunophenotype \\nand genetic profile.32  \\nTreatment of AML may include intensive \\nchemotherapy, newer targeted therapies, as well as \\nstem cell transplantation. New therapies included on \\nthe Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in the last \\nfive years include midostaurin and gilteritinib (FL T3 \\ninhibitors), gemtuzumab ozogomycin (CD33 targeting \\nantibody conjugate), venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) and \\noral azacitidine (hypomethylating agent).  \\nAML can arise without a prior blood cancer history \\n(de novo) or may result from transformation of \\na prior myeloid blood cancer (secondary) or may \\nalso develop as a result of prior radiotherapy or \\nchemotherapy for another cancer (therapy-related \\nAML or “AML post cytotoxic therapy”). A summary  \\nof the blood cancers which have transformed to AML \\nis shown in Figure 55. \\nFigure 54: Five-year relative survival for selected blood cancers in the period 1982-1986, 1997-2001 \\nand 2017-2021. \\n5-year relative survival0 20 40 60 80 1001982-1986\\n1997-2001\\n2017-202168.9%\\n70.6%\\n63.2%\\n38.4%\\n49.9%\\n35%\\n25.7%\\n28.5%\\n15.2%93.4%\\n90.1%\\n89.6%\\n86.7%\\n77.7%\\n69.5%\\n64%\\n44.4%\\n30%FL\\nHL\\nCLL\\nCML\\nALL\\nDLBCL\\nPCM\\nMDS\\nAML\\n0.2%\\n14.3%\\n61.9%23.6%NHL\\nMPN\\nMDSCMML or\\n MDS/MPNFigure 55: Distribution of blood cancers which have \\ntransformed to AML, 2015-2022. \\nIncidence and mortality: AML is a blood cancer \\nassociated with increasing age. Between 1982 \\nand 2022, 7,873 Victorians have been diagnosed \\nwith AML. In 2022, the median age at diagnosis \\nof AML was 71 years (IQR: 59-79 years). The age-\\nstandardised incidence rate of AML in 2022 was  \\n2.6 cases per 100,000. In Victoria in 2022, 178 males \\nand 131 females were diagnosed with AML, with  \\nan age-standardised incidence rate of 2.9 and  \\n2.4 cases per 100,000 respectively. The trend  \\nin AML crude incidence since 1982 is shown  \\nin Figure 56A. Since 1982, the annual percent \\nchange in AML age-standardised incidence rate  \\nis +0.5% (95% CI: 0.2, 0.7).  \\nIn 2022, 166 Victorians died from AML (100 males,  \\n66 females) at an age-standardised mortality rate  \\nof 1 death per 100,000. Since 2008, the crude \\nmortality rate has fallen (Figure 56B). Between 2007-\\n2014 mortality declined at an average annual rate  \\nof 0.7% (95% CI: -4.1%, 2.9%), although this change  \\nis not statistically significant. A significant reduction  \\nin annual mortality has been seen between 2014-\\n2018 (-14.7% [95% CI: -26.1%, -1.6%]), with a \\nstabilising in mortality over the last four years.  \\nSurvival and prevalence: Trends in five-year survival \\nby age groups is shown in Figure 56C. Relative survival \\nin the period 2017-2021 varies from 10% (95% CI: \\n8%, 13%) in those aged over 70 years to 62% (95% CI: \\n57%, 66%) in those aged under 60 years. One-year \\nrelative survival for AML cases transformed from MDS 80 81is 20.6% (95% CI: 15.1%, 26.2%), and from CMML  \\nor MDS/MPN is 30.5% (95% CI: 20.0%, 40.1%).  \\nThree-year relative survival for AML cases transformed \\nfrom MDS is 7.5% (95% CI: 3.5%, 11.5%), and from \\nCMML or MDS/MPN is 18.6% (95% CI: 9.1%, 28.1%). \\nSurvival estimates for those transforming from MPN \\nand NHL to AML cannot be reliably calculated due  \\nto low numbers involved.  \\nImproved survival likely reflects advances in supportive \\ncare, earlier diagnosis, improvements in therapeutic \\noptions and improvements in haemopoietic stem cell \\ntransplantation. Significant advances have also been BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA\\nMyelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)\\nMDS, also referred to as myelodysplasia, are blood \\ncancers that affect the production and function of \\nnormal blood cells that are usually produced in the \\nbone marrow. This can lead to a decreased number \\nof red blood cells (causing anaemia), white blood \\ncells (causing leukopenia with increased risk of \\ninfection) and platelets (causing thrombocytopenia \\nwith increased risk of bleeding). There are several \\nsubtypes of MDS that can be classified depending \\non the morphology, genetics, blood count deficiency \\nand proportion of immature “blast” cells in the bone \\nmarrow. Because of changes to the classification of \\nMDS, incidence data is only reported for the period \\n2000-2022 and mortality data from 2008.  \\nIncidence and mortality: MDS, like AML, is a blood \\ncancer associated with increasing age. Between 2000 \\nand 2022, 8,167 Victorians have been diagnosed with \\nMDS. In 2022, 425 Victorians were diagnosed with \\nMDS at an age-standardised incidence rate of 2.6 \\ncases per 100,000. The median age at diagnosis of \\nMDS is 77 years (range 5-101 years, IQR: 70-84 years). \\nMDS disproportionately affects males. In Victoria in \\n2022, 259 males and 166 females were diagnosed \\nwith MDS, with an age-standardised incidence rate \\nof 3.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 respectively.

CML, \\npolycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia \\n(ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are the four \\nclassic types of myeloproliferative neoplasms. From \\n1982 to 2022, there have been 3,078 diagnoses \\nof CML, 2,797 diagnoses of PV, 2,298 diagnoses of \\nET and 1,558 diagnoses of PMF among Victorians. \\nWhile our primary emphasis in this Focus is on CML, \\ncomprehensive details regarding other MPNs can be \\nrequested from the Victorian Cancer Registry.  \\nChronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)\\nCML is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm and \\nis a slow-progressing form of blood cancer that affects \\nmyeloid cells. CML is characterised by the Philadelphia \\nchromosome, that juxtaposes the BCR  and ABL1 genes \\nto form BCR ::ABL1 gene fusion. This fusion, in turn, \\ntriggers an overproduction of mature white blood cells \\noriginating from the bone marrow. It is considered a \\nrare blood cancer.  \\nIncidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022, \\nthere were 3,078 Victorians diagnosed with CML.  \\nThe median age at diagnosis of CML is 60 years  \\n(range 21-97, IQR: 44-72 years). The age-standardised \\nincidence rate of CML in 2022 was 0.9 cases per \\n100,000. In 2022, 92 Victorians were diagnosed \\nwith CML (48 males and 44 females), with an age-BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA\\nstandardised incidence rate of 1.0 and 0.9 cases per \\n100,000 respectively. Trend in CML crude incidence \\nsince 1982 is shown in Figure 58A. Since 1982, there \\nhas been an annual percent change of +0.3% (95% CI: \\n-0.1%, 0.7%) in the age-standardised rate of CML.  \\nIn 2022, 13 Victorians died from CML (5 males, 8 \\nfemales) at an age-standardised mortality rate of \\n0.08 case per 100,000. Since 2008, mortality rates \\nhave declined at an annual rate of 5.7% (95% CI: \\n-8.8%, -2.5%) with crude mortality rates indicating \\nthat the decline was most evident in Victorians aged \\n70 years and over (Figure 58B).  \\nSurvival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, \\nthere has been a 126% increase in five-year survival, \\nfrom 38% (95% CI: 25%, 52%) in 1982-1986 to 87% \\n(95% CI: 83%, 91%) in 2017-2021. Five-year survival \\nin the period 2017-2021 ranges from 63% in those \\naged 70 and above, to 95% in those aged under \\n60 years at diagnosis (Figure 58C). This significant \\nimprovement is in large part the result of tyrosine \\nkinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib (Glivec), that \\nwere developed to specifically target the abnormal \\nprotein produced by the BCR -ABL1 gene fusion that \\ndrives CML, which revolutionised therapy for this \\ncondition. TKIs continue to show remarkable efficacy \\nin controlling CML. \\nFive-year prevalence of CML has doubled over the \\npast two decades, from 225 to 454 Victorians alive \\nfive years after a diagnosis of CML. There are currently  \\n254 males and 200 females currently living with,  \\nor in remission from, CML diagnosed five years prior  \\nto 31 December 2022 (Figure 58D). 2. Plasma Cell Myelomas (PCM) \\nincluding Multiple Myeloma (MM)\\nPlasma cell myelomas (PCMs) are forms of blood \\ncancer that arise from the antibody-producing \\nplasma cells in the body. The most common form \\nof PCM is multiple myeloma, a chronic blood cancer \\ncaused by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, \\nthat can weaken bones, affect production of red cells, \\nelevate calcium levels and cause problems in other \\nbody organs such as the kidney. In Victoria, multiple \\nmyeloma accounts for 97% of plasma cell myelomas \\ndiagnosed between 2018 and 2022 (Figure 50).  \\nIncidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022 \\nthere were 14,229 Victorians diagnosed with PCM. \\nPCM is considered one of the more common blood \\ncancers, with a crude incidence rate of 9.7 cases per \\n100,000 persons. The age-standardised incidence \\nrate of PCM in 2022 was 4.5 cases per 100,000.  \\nThe median age at diagnosis of PCM is 73 years \\n(range: 35-99 years, IQR: 65-81 years). In Victoria \\nin 2022, 641 people (380 males and 261 females) \\nwere diagnosed with PCM, with an age-standardised \\nincidence rate of 5.6 and 3.6 cases per 100,000 \\nrespectively. Figure 59A demonstrates the extent to \\nwhich new diagnoses of PCM have increased over the \\npast four decades, particularly among older Victorians. \\nThe age-standardised incidence rate has increased \\nfrom 2.5 cases per 100,000 persons in 1982 to 4.5 cases \\nper 100,000 in 2022, or an average annual percent \\nchange between 1982-2018 of +2.2% (95% CI: 2%, \\n2.5%), with a plateau between 2018-2022.  \\nFigure 58: Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) trend in (A) age-standardised incidence and (B) mortality rates \\n(C) five-year survival by age groups; and (D) five-year prevalence among males and females.

B, T or NK Lymphoid Cell  \\nBlood Cancers\\nLymphoid cell blood cancers are cancers that \\noriginate from the lymphoid cells that are specific \\ntypes of white blood cells. These cancers can arise \\nfrom the bone marrow or other lymphoid tissues  \\nin the body and can be broadly categorised into \\nleukaemias and lymphomas. \\nAcute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL)\\nALL is a blood cancer that affects the bone marrow \\nand lymphoid tissues. Historically, subtypes of \\nALL were originally categorised according to their \\nmorphology, but further sub-categorisation is now \\nperformed based on the proteins expressed on the \\nleukaemia cells (immunophenotype) and genetics. \\nALL can manifest as leukaemia when immature \\nleukaemia cells rapidly accumulate in the bone \\nmarrow that disrupts normal blood cell production, \\nor as lymphoma when ALL cells accumulate in lymph \\nnodes or other lymphoid tissues, causing swelling  \\nand potential organ involvement. \\nIncidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022 \\nthere were 3,516 Victorians diagnosed with ALL.  \\nIn 2022, there were 69 males and 52 females \\ndiagnosed with ALL at a crude incidence rate of 1.8 \\ncases per 100,000 (Figure 60A). The age-standardised \\nincidence rate of ALL in 2022 was 2.5 cases per \\n100,000. The median age at diagnosis of ALL is \\n14 years (range: 0-86 years, IQR: 4-41). There are \\nproportionately more males diagnosed with ALL than \\nfemales (2.9 vs 2.1 cases per 100,000 respectively). \\nOver the past four decades, the age-standardised \\nrate of ALL has shown an average annual percentage \\nchange of +0.6% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.0%). ALL is the \\nmost common blood cancer seen among Victorians \\naged less than 15 years (Figure 53).  BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA\\nIn 2022, 28 Victorians died from ALL (10 males,  \\n18 females) at an age-standardised rate of 0.4 deaths \\nper 100,000. Since 2008, the crude mortality rate has \\ndeclined across all age groups (Figure 60B). The age-\\nstandardised mortality rate has declined at a constant \\nrate, with the annual percent change of 4.2% (95% CI: \\n-7.6%, -0.6%) over the period 2007-2022. The decline in \\nmortality was seen mainly in males compared to females \\n(-7.6% vs +1% annual percent change) over this period, \\nbut this was not statistically significant for females.\\nSurvival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, there \\nhas been a 56% increase in five-year survival after \\ndiagnosis of ALL, from 50% (95% CI: 40%, 60%) in \\n1982-1986 to 78% (95% CI: 74%, 81%) in 2017-2021. \\nNotably, five-year relative survival ranges from only \\n23% in those aged 60-69 years to 97% for those aged \\nunder 15 years at diagnosis (Figure 60C). During this \\nperiod, five-year survival among those aged under 15 \\nyears has improved from 67% (95% CI: 54%, 81%) to \\n97% (95% CI: 94%, 99%). \\nThe prevalence of people who have had an ALL \\ndiagnosis continues to increase as a result of high \\nremission rates achieved through advances in \\ntreatment protocols, including the development \\nof more effective chemotherapy regimens and \\ndevelopment of targeted therapies. Improvements in \\nthe supportive care for patients undergoing treatment, \\nas well as improvements in access and outcomes of \\nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the \\nadvent of newer immunotherapies are also likely to \\nhave contributed to improvement in overall survival. \\nThere has been a 75% increase in five-year prevalence \\nof ALL over the past two decades, from 268 to 469 \\nVictorians alive five years after a diagnosis of ALL. \\nThere are currently 278 males and 191 females living \\nwith, or in remission from, ALL diagnosed five years \\nprior to 31 December 2022 (Figure 60D). Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)\\nHL, previously known as Hodgkin’s disease, is a type \\nof lymphoma that originates from abnormal B-cells \\nand is morphologically characterised by the unique \\nappearance of “Reed-Sternberg cells” in lymphoid \\ntissue such as lymph nodes that are affected by \\ndisease. HL generally displays a more predictable \\nbehaviour and response to treatment than some \\nother forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). HL \\naccounts for approximately 7% of all lymphomas \\nand has a bi-modal age distribution. While absolute \\nnumber of cases diagnosed in young people each \\nyear is low, it is the second most commonly diagnosed \\nblood cancer among Victorians aged 0-14 years and \\nthe most commonly diagnosed blood cancer in those \\naged 15-30 years (Figure 53).  \\nIncidence and mortality: Between 1982 and  \\n2022 there were 5,746 Victorians diagnosed  \\nwith HL. The crude incidence rate in 2022 was  \\n3.3 cases per 100,000 with rates slightly higher \\namong older Victorians (Figure 61A). The age-\\nstandardised incidence rate of HL in 2022 was  \\n3.1 cases per 100,000. The median age at diagnosis \\nof HL is 36 years (range: 6-93 years, IQR: 23-61).  \\nThere are proportionately more males diagnosed \\nwith HL than females. In 2022, 130 males and  \\n88 females were diagnosed at an age-standardised  \\nrate of 3.6 and 2.6 cases per 100,000 respectively. \\nSince 1982, the age-standardised rate has shown  \\nan average annual percentage change of +1.2%  \\n(95% CI: 0.9%, 1.5%).  \\nIn 2022, 19 Victorians died from HL (9 males,  \\n10 females) at an age-standardised mortality rate \\nof 0.1 deaths per 100,000.

This is an increase \\nof 28% from the period 1982-1986, when five-\\nyear survival was 71% (95% CI: 64%, 77%). As \\ndemonstrated in Figure 61C, patients can live \\nfollowing a diagnosis of HL for an extended period, \\nparticularly if diagnosed at or under 70 years of age. \\nFor Victorians aged between 15-24 years, five-year \\nsurvival after a diagnosis of HL has reached 99% \\n(95% CI: 98%, 101%). Treatment of HL, that often \\nincludes chemotherapy and radiation therapy, has \\nbeen highly effective, with many patients achieving \\ncomplete remission and cure after treatment. The \\ndevelopment of combination therapy regimens has \\nsignificantly improved outcomes over time. While \\nhaemopoietic stem cell transplant has been used \\nfor patients with poor prognosis diseases, more \\nrecently, targeted therapies such as Brentuximab \\nand immune checkpoint inhibitors have also been \\napproved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory \\nHL, further improving survival. \\nOver the past two decades, there has been an 87% \\nincrease in five-year prevalence for people that have \\nreceived a HL diagnosis, from 526 to 986 Victorians \\nalive five years after a HL diagnosis.

These subtypes contribute to the overall \\ndiversity of B-cell lymphomas, each presenting with \\ndistinct characteristics requiring specific clinical \\nconsiderations.  \\n‒ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\nDLBCL is the most prevalent type of NHL. DLBCL \\naccounts for 20% of all lymphomas diagnosed \\nbetween 2018 and 2022. It is a more aggressive form  \\nof blood cancer characterised by the rapid growth  \\nof abnormal large B-cells that leads to the formation \\nof tumours in lymph nodes and other tissues. While it \\nis an aggressive type of NHL, advances in treatments, \\nincluding targeted therapies and in particular \\nimmunotherapy, have improved the outlook for many \\npatients diagnosed with DLBCL.  \\nAs with AML, since 2015, a number of DLBCL cases \\nhave developed or transformed from other preceding \\nblood cancers, with most cases being previously \\ndiagnosed with another form of NHL (n=497, 99.5%).  \\nIncidence and mortality: Between 1982 and  \\n2022 there were 15,313 Victorians diagnosed  \\nwith DLBCL. The median age at diagnosis of DLBCL \\nis 71 years (range 14-94, IQR: 60-78 years). The age-\\nstandardised incidence rate of DLBCL in 2022 was \\n4.5 cases per 100,000. In 2022, 560 Victorians were \\ndiagnosed with DLBCL (309 males and 251 females), BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA\\nwith an age-standardised incidence rate of 5.3  \\nand 3.8 cases per 100,000 respectively. Trend  \\nin DLBCL crude incidence since 1982 is shown  \\nin Figure 62A. Between 1982-1993, the age-\\nstandardised incidence rate of DLBCL increased  \\nwith an average annual percent change of 4.1% \\n(95% CI: 2.6%, 5.6%). Since then, DLBCL incidence \\nhas remained stable. \\nIn 2022, 232 Victorians (129 males and 103 females) \\ndied from DLBCL, at an age-standardised mortality \\nrate of 1.3 deaths per 100,000. Since 2008, there \\nhas been a modest decline in crude mortality rates \\nfollowing a diagnosis of DLBCL with higher rates \\nrecorded in those aged over 70 years (Figure 62B).  \\nAn annual percent change in age-standardised \\nmortality rate of -1.5% (95% CI: -2.2%, -0.7%) has \\nbeen recorded over the period 2007-2022, with similar \\nrates of decline among both males and females.  \\nSurvival and prevalence: Five-year survival after  \\na diagnosis of DLBCL has doubled over the last  \\n35 years, from 35% (95% CI: 29%, 42%) in the period \\n1982-1985 to 70% (95% CI: 67%, 72%) in the  \\nmost recent period, from 2017-2021.

The crude \\nincidence rate in 2022 was 8.2 cases per 100,000. \\nThere are proportionately more males diagnosed \\nwith CLL than females. Of those diagnosed with CLL \\nin 2022, there were 355 (66%) males and 186 (35%) \\nfemales, at an age-standardised rate of 5.6 and 2.7 \\ncases per 100,000 respectively. After an initial annual \\nincrease of 3.3% in age-standardised incidence \\nbetween 1982-1996, incidence rates have stabilised. \\nAn annual percent change of +12.6% (95% CI: 6.7%, 18.9%) between 2012-2017 was followed by an \\nannual percent change of -7.8% (95% CI: -10.8%, \\n-4.5%) between 2017-2022.  \\nIn 2022, 102 Victorians (62 males, 40 females) died \\nfrom CLL at an age-standardised mortality rate of 0.5 \\ndeaths per 100,000. The age-standardised mortality \\nrate following a diagnosis of CLL has declined from  \\n1.0 deaths per 100,000 in 2007, equating to an \\naverage percent change of -4.6% (95% CI: -6.3%, \\n-2.8%) between 2007-2022. This decline is seen \\nmainly in Victorians aged over 70 years (Figure 64B). \\nHowever, the results should be interpreted with \\ncaution, given the large increase in notifications  \\nin 2014 of cases which, in previous years were likely \\nnot reported to the Victorian Cancer Registry.  \\nSurvival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, \\nfive-year survival has improved across all age groups \\n(Figure 64C). It has increased 42%, from 63% (95% CI: \\n54%, 72%) in 1982-1986 to 90% (95% CI: 88%, 91%) \\nin 2017-2021. The steep incline in prevalence seen \\nbetween 2012-2017 reflects the dramatic increase  \\nin CLL incidence in cases which are likely to have had  \\na delayed notification to the VCR. \\nFive-year prevalence of CLL has increased by 144% \\nover the past 20 years, from 1,046 to 2,548 Victorians \\nalive five years after a diagnosis of CLL. For every three \\nmales living with CLL, there are two females currently \\nliving with the disease.

This data is used to describe \\ntrends in cancer incidence, mortality, stage of \\ndisease at diagnosis, and survival. It also provides \\na tool to identify changes and variation in patterns \\nof cancer among subgroups defined by geography, \\ndemography, and social characteristics. Made \\navailable to government, researchers and the wider \\ncommunity, our data is continually being used to \\nguide cancer prevention and control interventions to \\nimprove cancer outcomes for Victorians.    \\nData collection began from six public hospitals in \\nMelbourne on 1 January 1940. The registry grew \\nrapidly following introduction of the Cancer (Cancer \\nReporting) Act 1980, which mandated all hospitals \\nand pathology laboratories to report any patient \\nwith cancer.34  By 1982, the Victorian Cancer \\nRegistry became a population-based cancer registry \\nrecording all Victorians diagnosed and living with \\ncancer.     \\nThe Improving Cancer Outcomes Act 2014 (the Act) \\nestablished a modern, flexible, and principle-based \\nlegislative framework that provides for the collection, \\nuse and disclosure of cancer and cancer screening \\ninformation.35  \\nThe Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis \\nReporting) Regulations 2015 accompany the Act \\nand prescribe the types of cancer - or precursors to \\ncancer - to be reported, services that must notify, \\nand the timeframe in which a report must be made.36 \\nCancer registration    \\nThe data collected by the Victorian Cancer Registry is \\nspecified in User Guide: Cancer Registration Submission to \\nthe Victorian Cancer Registry  The User Guide states that \\nall melanoma skin cancers must be reported to the \\nVictorian Cancer Registry. In terms of non-melanoma \\nskin cancers, all in situ and malignant other skin \\ncancers (e.g. Merkel cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma) \\nof any site must be registered with the Victorian \\nCancer Registry, but only certain squamous cell \\ncarcinomas (SCC) must be registered.  Less common \\nnon-melanoma skin cancers are registered as \\n“other skin cancers. ” The registry also registers some \\nselected uncertain behaviour tumours of the central \\nnervous system (CNS) and brain, ovary, urinary tract \\nand haemopoietic system, and benign CNS tumours. \\nThese are not routinely reported in our publications.     The cancer registration process is described in \\nFigure 65. In 2022, the Victorian Cancer Registry \\nimplemented the Rapid Case Ascertainment \\n(RCA) module of the E-Path plus software to flag \\ncancer pathology registrations meeting particular \\nparameters set by three designated clinical trials. \\nThe aim of the project was to improve the timeliness \\nof identifying Victorians eligible for clinical trials \\nbased on their cancer type and genetic markers.  \\nThe study was finalised in October 2023, and results \\nwill be published in 2024.  \\nCancer notifiers   \\nThe Victorian Cancer Registry is notified of patients \\nwith cancer by day procedure centres, hospitals \\n(denominational, privately-owned, and public), \\npublic health services, radiation therapy centres, \\npathology services and prescribed registries.    \\nThe Victorian Cancer Registry receives notifications \\nof cancer from 262 hospitals, 11 radiation therapy \\ncentres, BreastScreen Victoria and 26 pathology \\nlaboratories. The Improving Cancer Outcomes \\n(Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 201536 state that \\na cancer must be reported by hospitals within 60 \\ndays of diagnosis and by pathology services within  \\n30 days of identifying the cancer, or cancer precursor.    \\nOur staff work cooperatively with the other seven \\npopulation-based cancer registries across Australia \\nto ensure that the registry captures Victorian \\nresidents who are diagnosed out-of-state.    \\nData supplied by the Victorian Registry of Births \\nDeaths and Marriages and the National Death Index \\nalso identifies Victorians who have cancer as a cause \\nof death on their death certificate.       \\nAs a quality control measure, BreastScreen data is \\nlinked with the Victorian Cancer Registry to identify \\ncancers diagnosed within screening intervals.     \\nCapturing cancer incidence   \\nCancer notifications are transmitted to the Victorian \\nCancer Registry where they are imported into the \\nE-Path Plus software. Most cancer notifications \\n(>98%) are received electronically. Pathology reports \\nare automatically imported into the software.

The morphology code has five \\ndigits; the first four digits identify the histological \\ntype and the fifth identifies the behaviour of the \\nneoplasm (malignant, in situ, benign, etc.).   \\nFor reporting purposes, the Victorian Cancer Registry \\nuses the International Statistical Classification \\nof Diseases and Related Health Problems,10th \\nrevision Australian Modified (ICD-10AM),31 which is \\nmapped and derived from ICD-O3 topography and \\nmorphology codes. Cancers are grouped by ICD-\\n10AM as shown in T able 6.    \\nThe Victorian Cancer Registry is a dynamic database. \\nDespite efforts to ensure that all cancer notifications \\nup to 31 December 2022 are received by the reports \\ncensorship date (14 October 2022), the registry \\nwill receive a small number of notifications after \\nthis date. Historically, there may be up to 300 new \\ndiagnoses identified from late notifications, as well \\nas amendments to existing cases because of new \\nnotifications and updates to tumour morphology or \\ndate of diagnosis.   \\nCapturing multiple primary tumours   \\nCancer incidence reflects the number of primary \\ntumours, rather than the number of people, \\ndiagnosed with cancer. A person may be diagnosed \\nwith multiple tumours over their lifetime.    \\nThe Victorian Cancer Registry captures multiple \\nprimary cancers in the same person according to \\nrules developed by the International Agency for \\nResearch on Cancer (IARC) and the International \\nAssociation of Cancer Registries (IACR).38 Capturing cancer mortality   \\nThe Victorian Cancer Registry routinely links with \\nthe National Death Index and the state-based \\ndeath registry to determine whether people who \\nhave been diagnosed with cancer have died. Medical \\ncoders refer to rules and guidelines described in the \\nInternational Classification of Diseases and Related \\nHealth Problems 31 to assist in determining cause of \\ndeath. Data from death certificates is augmented \\nwith data in the registry to determine the cancer site \\nand which tumour was responsible for the person’s \\ndeath.    \\nDeaths are coded to the 4-digit ICD-10 code if cancer \\nis determined by coders to be the underlying cause \\nof death, otherwise deaths are coded as non-cancer \\ndeaths and no further details are collected.    \\nPrior to 2007, the Victorian Cancer Registry relied \\nupon cause of death data from the Australian \\nBureau of Statistics (ABS). In 2007, the Victorian \\nCancer Registry medical coders began determining \\ncause of death data for a number of reasons: (1) they \\nhad more comprehensive data available to them, \\nincluding hospital admission data for recurrent or \\nmetastatic disease; (2) death certificates available \\nto the ABS were often insufficient to precisely code \\nhaematological malignancies; and (3) delay in \\nrelease of the ABS cause of death data meant that \\nit was not available for the previous year at the time \\nthe Victorian Cancer Registry released its report.    \\nData captured by the Victorian \\nCancer Registry   \\nThe registry collects a minimum dataset for each \\ntumour (T able 6). Additional prognostic data is \\ncaptured for breast cancer (size, hormone-receptor \\nstatus), prostate (Gleason score), and malignant \\nmelanoma (Clark’s level and Breslow thickness).     \\nE-Path Plus software automatically abstracts more \\nthan 200 data fields from pathology reports (Figure \\n65).

Demographic and tumour data \\nis checked for completeness and consistencies.     \\nMedical coders follow up with notifiers to obtain \\nsuspected missing or incomplete data.    \\nThe following three indices, defined in Cancer \\nIncidence in Five Continents39 are used to assess  \\nthe completeness of cancer data captured  \\nby population-based cancer registries:    \\n1. Proportion of cases registered from a death \\ncertificate only (DCO%): A high DCO% suggests \\nincomplete incidence notification, and such \\ndiagnoses may be less accurate. For DCO cases, the \\ndate of diagnosis is taken as the date of death if it \\nis not mentioned on the certificate.    2. Proportion of cases verified with morphology \\n(MV%): A low MV% suggests incomplete \\nregistration of pathology reports, poorer \\nverification of diagnoses and incomplete \\nregistration of cancers for which this is often  \\nthe only source of notification, such as melanoma. \\nThe higher the MV% for cancers  \\nof less accessible sites, like brain and pancreas, the \\ngreater the confidence that the neoplasm existed \\nand was primary rather than metastatic.   \\n3. Mortality to incidence ratio (M/I%): When the \\nquality of the mortality data is good (especially \\nin terms of the accuracy of cause of death) and \\nincidence and survival are in steady state, the M:I \\nratio is approximated by 1 minus the five-year \\nsurvival probability.  \\nSite DCO (%) MV (%) M/I (%)\\nAll malignant tumours 1.3 93.2 33\\nHead & Neck 0.2 97.9 20\\nOesophagus 1.1 92.3 77\\nStomach 1.2 94.2 58\\nBowel 1.2 94.7 37\\nLiver 3.2 58.7 73\\nGallbladder 4.9 78.4  75\\nPancreas 3.5 74.8 86\\nLung 2.1 85.9 67\\nMelanoma 0.1 99.8 9\\nBreast 0.4 99.1 15\\nVulva\\xa0etc 1.0 97.4 45\\nUterus 0.4 98.9 20\\nProstate 0.9 96.4 15\\nKidney 1.4 90.1 22\\nBladder 1.5 94.1 43\\nBrain & CNS 1.0 87.2 86\\nThyroid 0.2 99.0  4\\nUnknown primary site 12.1 52.1 80\\nLymphoma 0.5 97.3 29\\nMultiple\\xa0myeloma 1.9 95.6 37\\nLeukaemia 1.9 93.9 31\\nMyeloproliferative\\xa0&\\xa0myelodysplastic 2.3 88.4 30T able 8 Data quality indices by tumour type for tumours diagnosed in 2022.  \\n100 101APPENDIX 2:  \\nST A TISTICAL METHODOLOGY\\nAge-standardised rates   \\nThe Victorian age-standardised rates (ASR) in \\nthis publication are based on the World Standard \\nPopulation (Cancer Incidence in Five Continents \\nVolume 10, 2014, IARC).39 These rates are calculated \\nusing the direct method 40 by summation of the \\nweighted age-specific rates. The standard error  \\n(SE) of each ASR is given in the tables; a 95% \\nconfidence interval for the rate can be estimated  \\nby (rate ± 1.96 SE).   \\nAnnual percent change  \\nAnnual percent change (APC) provides a means of \\ndescribing trends in age-standardised incidence and \\nmortality rates over time.  APCs in this report are \\ncalculated using the joinpoint software (version 4.9.0.0; \\nhttps://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/), where a \\n“joinpoint” refers to a specific point in a time trend \\nwhere a significant change in the direction or rate \\nof the trend occurs. Joinpoint analysis is a statistical \\nmethod used to identify these joinpoints and assess \\nwhether there are significant changes in trends \\nover time.41 Calculated using a log transformation \\napproach, it provides a means of characterising \\ntrends using a consistent scale. The reported annual \\npercentage change reflects the ACP of the latest \\nperiod, unless otherwise stated. \\nCancer projections   \\nCancer projections are intended as a guide to assist \\nin understanding from observed data what future \\nrates of cancer are expected to look like in Victoria. \\nImportantly, projection estimates should be used with \\ncaution, as they are influenced by past fluctuations in \\nspecific cancer rates. This is notable when assessing \\nprostate cancer which has shown large fluctuation \\nover the past three decades (see Incidence chapter). \\nProjection estimates also do not consider any \\nuncertainty around the future population estimates. \\nEstimates of future population size by age and sex \\nwere obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics \\n(catalogue #3222.0, series B, 2022-2071, released on \\n23/11/2023).42 \\nCancer projection uses an age-period-cohort \\nmodel with a power link function to project cancer \\nincidence and mortality by sex for the next 15 years. \\nStatistical analysis was performed using Nordpred \\nsoftware package in R version 3.6.3.43 For incidence \\nand mortality projections, incidence, mortality, and \\npopulation data were aggregated into 5-year age \\ngroups and 5-year periods from 1982-2022 for all \\ncancers. Projection was based on the last 15, 20, 25 or 30 years depending on a goodness of fit test.   \\nCases and deaths for all cancers were projected for \\nthree 5-year periods (see T ables 2 and 4). For each \\n5-year period, projected incidence and mortality \\npresented are the annual average for that period. Only \\nage groups with at least 10 cases or deaths in total \\nwere used in the model for projections. Age groups \\nwith less than 10 cases or deaths were projected as \\nthe average from the last 10 years.   \\nT wo different models were run to obtain projections; \\nModel 1 used all available data (1982 to 2022), \\nwhereas Model 2 included only pre-COVID data \\n(1982-2019). Since we have seen fewer diagnoses \\nthan expected, we wanted to create a projection that \\ntook into account that the ‘missed diagnoses’ will \\npresent in the future.  \\nRegistry-derived stage (RD-Stage)   \\nRD Stage was introduced for select cancers in 2014 \\nto address a deficit in the reporting of cancer stage by \\nhospitals. The Victorian Cancer Registry has for some \\nyears derived stage for selected cancers using data \\navailable from pathology reports and from hospital \\nnotifications reporting coded metastatic disease \\nsites at diagnosis, augmented by reported stage \\nfrom hospitals and radiotherapy services where this \\nis available. The derivation rules were the starting \\npoint for the national Business Rules developed and \\nevaluated in 2015 by the Victorian Cancer Registry as \\na national project under the Cancer Australia Staging, \\nTreatment and Recurrence (ST aR) initiative.44   \\nIt is recognised that stage derived using these \\nbusiness rules may differ from stage obtained through \\nmultidisciplinary meetings and by clinicians for use \\nin patient management but is the best available \\nmeasure of stage for use at a population level. T o \\nclearly distinguish this registry-derived stage from \\nthat from multi-disciplinary team meetings (MDT) or \\nclinicians, the name “Registry-Derived Stage” (or RD-\\nStage in short) has been adopted.    \\nRD-Stage provides a useful tool to examine variation \\nin practice across geographic regions, age groups \\nand cancer types, and to explore the impact of cancer \\nscreening on disease presentation.    \\nDetails of the definitions and business rules for RD-\\nStage are available on request. These are based on \\nTNM 7th Edition for breast and bowel cancers45 and \\nTNM 8th Edition for melanoma and endometrial \\ncancer.46 Because of significant changes made to \\nthe staging system for prostate cancer between the 7th and the 8th edition, the International Society of \\nUrological Pathology (ISUP) grading system47 has been \\nused to describe prostate cancer stage in this report. \\nAs with lower stage, a lower ISUP group indicates \\nless invasive disease. Small numbers of tumours with \\nmorphology not eligible for TNM staging have been \\nexcluded from RD-Stage calculation.     \\nRelative survival    \\nThe survival results in this report are relative survival \\nestimates. Relative survival is the survival of a person \\nwith cancer compared with the expected survival \\nfor a person of the same age and sex in the general \\npopulation, extracted from Victorian specific life \\ntables obtained from the Australian Bureau of \\nStatistics (ABS; catalogue #3302055001).9  \\nSurvival figures presented in this report are outcomes \\nfrom a “period” survival analysis. Only the most recent \\ninterval survival estimates for cases diagnosed in \\ndifferent calendar years (cross-sectional estimate \\nof survival) are used. The estimate of period 5-year \\nsurvival for persons in 2017-2021 uses the 1-year \\ninterval survival for patients diagnosed in 2020, the 2-year interval survival for patients diagnosed in 2019, \\nand so on. Because the “period” method uses only the \\nmost recent survival experience it provides the most \\nup-to-date measure of recent survival.  Period survival \\nwas calculated using the Ederer II relative survival \\nmethod,48 calculated using the ‘periodR’ package.49 \\nUsing this approach, 56% five-year survival does not \\nmean that 56/100 cancer patients are alive five years \\nlater but 56% (about half) as many of this group \\nwould survive compared with a group the same age \\nand sex from the general population. Thus, the actual \\nproportion surviving would differ between age groups \\neven if relative survival were the same.    \\nWe show here an example of relative survival for two \\nfictional groups of 100 cancer patients aged <30 \\nand >85 years - based on life tables for the whole \\nVictorian population, we would expect to have 95 \\nand 35 persons of the general population surviving \\nafter five years. If the relative survival was 56% for \\neach group, the number of cancer patients who \\nsurvived would be 56% of 95 =53 persons for the \\nyounger group and 56% of 35=20 persons for the \\nolder group. So, the same relative survival proportion \\n102 103does not mean the same proportion of deaths in \\nthe cancer group, but the same excess proportion of \\ndeaths.   \\nT o present accurate survival statistics, it is necessary \\nto identify deaths occurring in all Australian States \\nand T erritories for persons included in the incidence \\ndata. Many persons resident in Victoria at time of \\ndiagnosis subsequently move interstate. Notification \\nof deaths occurring within Victoria are received \\nmonthly from the Victorian Registrar of Births, \\nDeaths and Marriages, but for deaths in other states, \\nit is necessary to link the annual incidence file to \\nthe National Death Index (NDI); at the Australian \\nInstitute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The latest \\nlinkage to the NDI allows us to include interstate \\ndeaths that occurred in 2021 for people who were \\nresidents of Victoria at the time of cancer diagnosis \\nbut died outside of Victoria.  \\nRelative survival can be above 100% which indicates \\nthat survival is better in the group of interest \\ncompared with the age/sex-matched Victorian \\npopulation. We see this for example in early-stage \\nbreast and prostate cancer.   \\nPrevalence \\nThis report provides person-based limited-duration \\nprevalence; that is, the number of people diagnosed \\nwith cancer within a specific period (e.g., 2 years, 5 \\nyears or 10 years) who were still alive on the index \\ndate. Eligible cases included in the prevalence counts \\nwere defined as having: \\n\\uf097 a diagnosis date in between the index date and \\nthe diagnosis cut-off date, with the diagnosis cut-\\noff date calculated as the index date minus the \\nspecific period of interest,  \\n\\uf097 no death date, or a death date greater than or \\nequal to the index date. \\nAges of eligible cases were calculated from the index \\ndate and cases with an age greater than 105 years \\nwere excluded from the dataset as they may have \\nmigrated overseas and therefore been lost to follow-\\nup. All age specific calculations were based on the age \\ncalculated from the index date. \\nPopulation data used to calculate the percentage of \\ndifferent portions of the Victorian population living \\nwith a history of cancer were based on the Victorian \\nEstimated Residential Population from ABS as at 1 \\nyear prior to the index date year. APPENDIX 2:  \\nST A TISTICAL METHODOLOGY\\nStatistical modelling to estimate the effect  \\nof COVID in new diagnoses \\nPoisson regression was used to estimate the direction \\nand magnitude of trends in incidence for each cancer \\ntype by age group and sex using pre-COVID data up to \\n2019, using the following model with monthly data: \\n[Equation]  + interactions(sex x age +  year x sex +  year x age \\n+ year x sex x age) +  residual \\nwhere month, sex and age group were categorical \\nvariables while year was included as a continuous \\nvariable. The expected number of new diagnoses in \\n2020, 2021 and 2022 were estimated by applying this \\nmodel on 2020-2022 population data. The observed \\nnumber of new diagnoses was compared with the \\nexpected number (and 95% CI) in absolute and \\nrelative sense. \\nFor each tumour type, the start of the pre-COVID \\nperiod was defined as the start of the latest period \\nduring which incidence rates, for males and females, \\ndid not change. This period was obtained using \\nthe joinpoint software (version 4.9.0.0; https://\\nsurveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/) using all default \\nsettings.41 When the period differed for males and \\nfemales, the longest common period was used as pre-\\nCOVID period, up to 2019. APPENDIX 3:  \\nRESEARCH AND PUBLICA TIONS \\nUSING VCR DAT A  \\nHow we support cancer care  \\nin Victoria   \\nThe Victorian Government has developed a Victorian \\nCancer Plan 2020-24, which sets an agenda for \\nactivity aimed at preventing cancer, increasing \\nsurvival, improving cancer treatments and care, and \\nachieving equitable outcomes for all Victorians with \\ncancer.50 Data from the Victorian Cancer Registry is \\nused to assess the progress of the plan in realising \\nits goals. It is also used to help plan the delivery of \\ncancer care in Victoria. Local hospitals and cancer \\nservices use our data to help them manage cancer \\nservice delivery, plan for future cancer needs in their \\ncommunity, undertake audit, and deliver quality \\nimprovement activities.    \\nHow we contribute to cancer research  \\nin Australia    \\nWe provide cancer data to the Australian Cancer \\nDatabase (ACD), which is hosted by the Australian \\nInstitute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The ACD \\ncollects data from each state and territory in \\nAustralia, and is a central repository of information \\nabout primary, malignant cancers. The AIHW uses \\nthis data to report national cancer incidence, trends, \\nprojections, survival, and prevalence. These statistics \\nhelp to inform cancer prevention and treatment \\nstrategies and monitor the impact of policies at a \\nnational level.     \\nThe AIHW makes the data from the ACD public via its \\nwebsite at https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-\\ndata/our-data-collections/australian-cancer-\\ndatabase/about-australian-cancer-database.  \\nHow we contribute to global research   \\nWe provide de-identified data to the International \\nAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to contribute \\nto global statistics on cancer incidence, prevalence, \\nand mortality. This year, we continue to contribute \\nde-identified data to IARC’s global effort to better \\nunderstand the impact of COVID-19 on cancer \\nincidence, treatments, and outcomes.  We also \\ncontribute to the International Cancer Benchmarking \\nPartnership (ICBP), a partnership which brings together \\nclinicians, policymakers, researchers and data experts \\nfrom Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New \\nZealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom \\nto measure variation in cancer incidence, mortality, \\nsurvival, stage at diagnosis and survival by stage, and \\nfactors which might be driving variation.51     Research supported by our data   \\nWe respond to requests for data from government \\nagencies, integrated cancer services, community \\nservices and researchers. Requests are made for \\ndata to explore disparities in cancer incidence and \\ntreatment, identify cancer clusters, and support \\nquality improvement activities.    \\nIn addition to formal requests lodged for our data, \\nit is possible to obtain comprehensive cancer data \\nthrough the publicly available Data Explorer (Figure \\n66). The Data Explorer allows people to delve into \\nthe Victorian cancer data and explore trends in \\nincidence, prevalence, and survival over time and \\nby sub-groups, such as Integrated Cancer Service, \\nAboriginal and/or T orres Strait Islander status, and \\nsocio-economic quintile.      \\nFigure 66: VCR Data Explorer, available to use  \\non website at https://www.cancervic.org.au/\\nresearch/vcr \\nIn 2022, we serviced 116 data requests and undertook \\n59 data linkages. This is a 19% decline on previous \\nyears, likely due to our data being made more \\naccessible and available via the website. Most data \\naccess requests were submitted by health care \\norganisations (51%), followed by researchers (25%), \\nCancer Council requests (13%), state government \\n(7%), and community and federal agencies (4%). \\n104 1052022 Publications arising from  \\nVCR Date \\nResearch project requests for registry data through the \\nVictorian Cancer Registry, the Australian Institute of \\nHealth and Welfare, and the Centre for Victorian Data \\nLinkage resulted in the following 96 peer-reviewed \\npublications in 2022.\\xa0\\xa0\\n1 Ahearn TU, Zhang H, Michailidou K, et al.

While pre-cancers \\nare not included in the body of this report, they \\nare listed here as they may provide insight into the \\nimpact of screening, immunisation and public health \\nmessaging on early detection.    \\nT able 9 summarises the distribution of in situ \\nmelanoma and breast cancers and cervical pre-\\ncancerous abnormalities captured by the Victorian \\nCancer Registry.    \\nIn Victoria, women have access to regular screening \\nfor breast and cervix cancers through BreastScreen \\nVictoria and the National Cervical Screening \\nProgram. As a result, we expect to see in situ \\nincidence increasing as cancers are detected  \\nearlier. This early detection is expected to be \\naccompanied by decreasing numbers of invasive \\ncancers over time.    APPENDIX 4:  \\nIN SITU CANCERS AND DYSPLASIA \\nDefinition of in situ cancers    \\nIn situ melanomas are abnormal cells that have not \\nextended beyond the epidermis into the dermis.     \\nIn situ breast cancers are abnormal cells that have \\nnot spread outside the ducts or lobules into breast \\ntissue. They include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), \\nlobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and other unspecified \\ncarcinoma of the breast.      \\nCervical pre-cancerous abnormalities can develop \\nfrom squamous or glandular cells. Abnormal \\nsquamous cells are known as low-grade (LSIL) or \\nhigh-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). \\nThe registry only receives notification of HSIL or more \\nadvanced pre-cancerous cells. Abnormal glandular \\ncells are known as adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS).  \\nHSIL and AIS are both caused by the human \\npapillomavirus infection and may become invasive \\ntumours if left untreated.Age groupCervix Breast Melanoma\\nFemale Female Male Female\\nCases Age-\\nspecific \\nrateCases Age-\\nspecific \\nrateCases Age-\\nspecific \\nrateCases Age-\\nspecific \\nrate\\n0-4 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0\\n5-9 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0\\n10-14 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0\\n15-19 3 1.6 0 0.0 3 1.5 1 0.5\\n20-24 57 27.7 0 0.0 2 0.9 6 2.9\\n25-29 523 217.3 2 0.8 13 5.2 18 7.5\\n30-34 528 202.0 6 2.3 34 13.4 39 14.9\\n35-39 363 143.1 19 7.5 36 14.4 53 20.9\\n40-44 246 110.0 41 18.3 68 31.1 78 34.9\\n45-49 166 79.5 79 37.8 91 44.8 120 57.5\\n50-54 104 48.5 145 67.6 193 94.6 173 80.7\\n55-59 71 36.3 96 49.1 228 122.7 201 102.9\\n60-64 56 29.6 104 54.9 287 162.4 247 130.4\\n65-69 37 22.1 95 56.8 317 207.6 274 163.8\\n70-74 32 21.8 86 58.5 397 300.2 278 189.0\\n75-79 7 6.2 42 37.2 332 328.3 249 220.7\\n80-84 0 0.0 31 39.7 217 332.5 131 167.9\\n85+ 0 0.0 12 13.9 134 240.3 100 115.4\\nT otal   2,193   758  2,352  1,968 \\nCumulative \\nrate (%)4.7 1.8 5.0 4\\nLifetime risk  \\n(to age 75)1 in 21 1 in 56 1 in 20 1 in 258\\nAge-\\nstandardised \\nrate58.0 14.4 35.2 30.6T able 9: In situ melanoma, in situ breast and cervical pre-cancer abnormalities reported in 2022: Number of new \\ncases and age-specific rate per 100,000110 111REFERENCES\\n1.
