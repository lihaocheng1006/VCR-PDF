 Welcome to Cancer in Victoria 2022, an annual report 
produced by the Victorian Cancer Registry. This report 
provides a snapshot of cancer activity in 2022 and 
examines trends in cancer diagnoses, deaths, survival, 
and prevalence since 1982.  
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains 
an important issue, as again this year we see fewer 
diagnoses than we would have expected to see.  
This expectation is based on historical trends in 
cancer diagnoses and deaths and considers changes 
in our Victorian population. It is difficult to determine 
the true impact, but based on historical trends 
between 1982-2019, we estimate that there were 
about 6,660 fewer diagnoses than expected for the 
period 2020-2022. This excludes prostate cancer,  
for which historical trends make it difficult to 
accurately assess missed diagnoses. These statistics 
serve as a salient reminder for Victorians to attend 
their general practitioner if they have health 
concerns and for routine health checks. Our statistics 
demonstrate that early diagnosis of cancer has  
a survival benefit.   
The extended impact of COVID-19 makes it 
increasingly difficult to project cancer incidence  
to 2035. For this reason, we have included two 
models in our estimates. One model is based on 
historical data, excluding 2020-2022 in anticipation 
of these diagnoses being made in the future.  
The other model includes the recent declines  
and projects fewer diagnoses in 2037. Based on 
these two models, it is expected that there will be 
between 51,366 and 56,523 new diagnoses reported 
in the 2033-2037 period. This year, we report blood cancer statistics for the 
first time in detail. Blood cancers constitute 13% 
of all cancers in Victoria, and while there are more 
than 200 sub-categories classified by the World 
Health Organization, our focus is on the predominant 
categories. For those interested in examining 
individual blood cancers not included in this report, 
along with other cancers, trends in diagnoses, deaths, 
and five-year survival spanning four decades, as well 
as disparities according to location of residence and 
its associated socioeconomic index, country of birth, 
Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander heritage, and 
cancer services, we invite you to visit our website at 
https://www.cancervic.org.au/research/vcr and delve 
into our interactive Data Explorer.   
The statistics presented in this report are sourced from 
a comprehensive network, including 262 hospitals, 
10 radiation therapy centres, BreastScreen Victoria, 
each of the 26 Victorian pathology providers, and 
the 7 interstate cancer registries. T ogether, 217,946 
documents were processed by the Victorian Cancer 
Registry medical coder team to identify the 36,299 
new diagnoses in 2022, and update data from previous 
years. The Registry is proud to be among the first in the 
world to deliver the 2022 cancer statistics and we’re 
eager to see whether other cancer registries observe  
an ongoing impact of COVID-19 on cancer statistics.     
The Victorian Cancer Registry, supported by the 
Victorian Government's funding, is dedicated 
to maintaining Victoria's leading position in 
comprehensively describing the epidemiology  
of cancer. For further information, please contact

8 9GLOSSARY
Age-specific rate Provides information on the incidence of a particular event in an age group 
relative to the total number of people at risk of that event in the same age 
group. It is calculated by dividing the number of events occurring in each 
specified age group by the corresponding ‘at-risk’ population in the same  
age group and then multiplying the result by a constant (for example, 
100,000) to derive the rate. Age-specific rates are expressed per 100,000 
population in this report.  
Age-standardised rate 
(ASR)Provides the capacity to compare different populations and time periods where 
different age structures exist.  It is calculated by applying a weighted average 
(based on a standard population) of the number of new cases or deaths per 
100,000, with the weights being equal to the proportion of people in each age 
group in a chosen standard population.  
Cancer incidence Refers to the number of new cancer cases diagnosed during a specific period  
in a population. Incidence reflects the number of cancer cases and not the 
number of individuals with cancer; one person may have multiple cancers and 
each one might be included when calculating cancer incidence, based  
on internationally agreed rules.
Cancer mortality The number of deaths attributed to cancer during a specific period in a defined 
population, regardless of when the diagnosis was made. 
Cancer of Unknown 
Primary site (CUP)A group of metastatic tumours for which no primary tumour has 
been identified despite a screen of investigations, with specialist 
review. The diagnosis usually requires pathology evaluation, including 
immunohistochemistry markers to define the tumour cell lineage. This group 
also includes patients who present with advanced disease but for whom 
further tests are not done because a definitive diagnosis is not likely to affect 
treatment choices or prognosis. Represents less than 1.5% of all cancers 
reported by the Victorian Cancer Registry.
Crude rate (CR) The number of new cancer cases (or deaths) divided by the population at risk  
in the specific period, expressed as an annual rate per 100,000 population.  
No age adjustments are made when calculating a crude rate.   
Cumulative risk An estimate of the total risk that a certain event will happen during a given 
period. This report refers to the cumulative risk of a person being diagnosed 
with cancer by the age of 75.  
Death certificate only 
(DCO%)The proportion of cases registered from a death certificate. 
Five-year survival Survival in this report refers to ‘relative survival’; the likelihood of a person 
diagnosed with cancer surviving for a certain amount of time compared 
with similar people in the general population. ‘Similar’ in this case is defined 
by a person of the same sex, age and year (ie. Survival of a 74 year-old male 
diagnosed in 2016 is compared with the life expectancy of all males who turned 
74 in 2016). A relative five-year survival rate of 100% means that as many 
people with cancer will die as those in a similar population without cancer  
over a five-year period.   
Histology The study of tissues and cells under a microscope. In situ A group of abnormal cells that are found only in the place where they first 
formed in the body. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread to 
nearby normal tissue. 
International 
Classification of Diseases 
for Oncology (ICD-O) An international standard for classifying a cancer using a topographical code,  
which describes the anatomical site of origin (or organ system) of the tumour,  
and a morphological code, which describes the cell type (or histology) of the 
tumour, together with the behaviour (malignant or benign). Medical coders 
classify cancers according to the 3rd edition (ICD-O-3).32
International 
Classification of Diseases 
and Related Health 
Problems (ICD-10)An international standard developed to promote international comparability  
in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of health 
statistics.31
Invasive cancer Cancer that has spread beyond the layer of tissue in which it developed and  
is growing into surrounding, healthy tissues.  
Microscopic verification 
(MV%)The proportion of cases verified with morphology.
Morphology The histological classification of the cancer tissue and a description of the 
course of development that a tumour is likely to take (benign or malignant).  
Projection An estimate or forecast of future cancer incidence or mortality based on trends 
extracted from historical data applied to estimates of future population. Cancer 
projection uses an age-period-cohort (APC) model which considers age effects 
(i.e. biological and social processes linked to ageing), period effects (i.e. external 
effects impacting all groups) and cohort effects (i.e. the unique exposure/
experience of a group as they move across time).   In this report we project 
cancer incidence and mortality by sex for the next 15 years. 
Remoteness Remoteness classification is applied to the patients’ residence at the time 
of cancer diagnosis. Geographical areas are grouped to major cities, inner-
regional, outer-regional and remote Victoria according to the Australian Bureau 
of Statistics remoteness structure.  
Registry-derived Stage 
(RD-Stage)The stage of disease at diagnosis, which is derived by registry staff applying 
rules to data available to a population-based cancer registry. Registry-derived 
stage has been developed in consultation with clinicians and is intended to 
be used for population reporting purposes and not at a patient-level to guide 
clinical practice.   
Standardised Incidence 
Ratio (SIR)/ Standardised 
mortality ratio (SMR)Used to gain an understanding of whether the number of observed cancer cases 
in a particular population is higher or lower than expected, given the population 
and age distribution for that population. It is calculated by dividing the observed 
number of cases by the “expected” number of cases. If more cases are observed 
than expected, the SIR is greater than 1. If fewer cases are observed than 
expected, the SIR is less than 1. 
Y ears of Potential Life 
Lost (YPLL)The  total number of years of life lost due to a premature death from cancer. In 
this report, a premature death is one which occurs before a person reaches 75 
years. For example, someone who died from cancer at the age of 68 equates to 
7 years of potential life lost.
2022 IN NUMBERSMelanoma, prostate, breast, bowel , and lung cancer 
account for 56% of all cancer diagnoses in Victoria. 
There were over 6,600 fewer cancer diagnoses than 
expected between 2020 – 2022.
Between the ages of 15 and 54 years, females are 
more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than males, 
but more males are diagnosed with cancer overall.
Melanoma diagnoses in regional Victoria are 47% 
higher than in major cities while head and neck cancer 
diagnoses are 33% higher.   
Over 350,000 Victorians alive today have been 
diagnosed with cancer within the past four decades.
Across all cancers, the 5-year survival rate is 73% for 
females and, for the first time, survival for males has 
reached 70%.32 people die from cancer every day.   Aboriginal Victorians have a 12% lower five-year 
survival rate at 60% compared to non-Aboriginal 
Victorians at 72% 
10 11Werribee, VictoriaCancer is the leading cause of death and a leading 
cause of disease burden in Victoria. 
In 2022, 35,656 Victorians were diagnosed  
with cancer. That’s an average of 98 people 
diagnosed every day.   
Five-year survival after a diagnosis of leukaemia in 
children aged less than 15 years has improved by 45% 
over the last 35 years.
Blood cancer diagnoses increased by 1% annually 
until 2020, with a consistent 2% annual decline in 
blood cancer deaths over the past 15 years.

Victoria’s population is growing 
Victoria is the second most populous state in Australia 
after New South Wales¹, and accounts for one quarter 
of Australia’s population, but less than 3% of the 
country’s land area. 
As at 30 June 2022, there were approximately 
6,630,258 people living in Victoria, of whom 
3,277,603 (49.4%) were males and 3,352,655 (50.6%) VICTORIA’S POPULA TION IN 2022

Index of Australia (ARIA+), which considers road distance from a point to the nearest urban centres and localities.
Major citiesInner regionalOuter regionalRemoteFigure 1: Map of Victoria by Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Remoteness Structure1were females. This is an increase of about 82,436 
people or 1.3% compared to 30 June 2021.2 In 1982, 
the Victorian Cancer Registry reached the milestone 
of capturing cancer statistics for all Victorians. At that 
time, there were approximately four million people 
residing in Victoria. Since then, there has been a 66% 
increase in the population the registry serves.3
The year 2022 saw a return to positive population 
growth in Victoria. There was a decline in population 
from the second quarter of 2020 until the first quarter, 
2022. The removal of border restrictions from February 
2022 enabled overseas travel and saw a recovery in 
the net overseas migration throughout 2022.2 
In total, 77% of Victorians live in major cities, 19% live 
in inner regional areas, 4% live in outer regional areas 
and less than 1% live in remote regions (Figure 1).4Aboriginal Victorians represent 1.0%  
of all Victorians 
According to the 2021 Census of Population and 
Housing, 65,646 Victorians identified as Aboriginal 
representing 1.0% of Victoria’s population and  
8.1% of the Aboriginal and/or T orres Strait Isander 
population in Australia.5  The median age for 
Aboriginal and/or T orres Strait Islander people  
in Victoria in 2021 was 24 years, up from 23 years  
in 2016 and 22 years in 2011. Half (50.2%) of the 
Aboriginal people in Victoria people live in Greater 
Melbourne. The Victorian Cancer Registry is working 
with the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled 
Health Organisation (VACCHO), to support the 
Aboriginal community to develop and implement 
culturally safe services and programs to improve 
cancer outcomes for Aboriginal Victorians.
About one in three households use a language 
other than English   
Country of birth data is available at the state level 
only in the census years. Based on the 2021 Census, 
2,072,570 (31.7%) Victorians are born overseas, an 
increase of just 1% from the previous census in 2016. 
Of those born overseas, the highest proportion come 
from India (272,250 or 13.1%), followed by China 
(182,140 or 8.8%) and England (181,440 or 8.8%).6  
The most common ancestries reported by Victorians 
are English (29%), Australian (27%), Irish (9.4%), 
Scottish (8.2%) and Chinese (6.6%).7 A language other 
than English is used in 30% of Victorian households, 
with the most common languages spoken at 
home, other than English, being Mandarin (3.4%), 
Vietnamese (1.8%), Greek (1.6%), Punjabi (1.6%), 
Italian (1.4%), and Arabic (1.4%).  
Victorians are living longer
Australia has one of the highest life expectancies 
in the world, with only Japan and Monaco ranking 
higher.8 In Victoria, life expectancy at birth is 85.5 
years for females and 81.6 years for males. This is  
an increase of 1 year for females and 1.1 years for 
males over the past decade.9 
However, life expectancy is not equally distributed.  
The median age of Aboriginal and T orres Strait 
Islander people in Australia is 24.0 years,10 while  
the median age of Victorians living in Melbourne  
is 36.9 years and in the rest of Victoria is 43.2 years.11 
People aged 65 years and over comprise 5.4%  
of the Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander 
population compared with 17.2% of the non-
Aboriginal population.10 “Part of my role is taking the time to ask 
how distressed somebody is and what’s 
causing that distress and then really being 
able to knuckle down how to help them 
with that. ”
Having grown up in a rural town, Janaya 
Dwyer is passionate about increasing access 
to supportive care in regional and rural areas 
where people are ten per cent more likely to be 
diagnosed with cancer than those in major cities.  
Based at Bendigo Regional Cancer Centre, 
Janaya divides her time between providing 
information and support on the Cancer 
Council Victoria 13 11 20 line and travelling 
to regional health services presenting cancer 
information as a Regional Rural Liaison in the 
Loddon Mallee region.  
“Our service covers prevention and screening 
all the way up to treatment, diagnosis, 
survivorship issues and end of life care. So, 
anyone impacted by cancer, who wants 
information or support, ” said Janaya. 
With years of oncology nursing experience 
behind her, she jumped at the chance to have 
a direct impact in and around her hometown. 
Where clinical nurses may have limited time 
to chat, Janaya is able to take the time to 
have these important conversations and 
give emotional support, which is vital to the 
delivery of quality cancer care throughout a 
person’s cancer journey.  
“Survival rates are changing, we are seeing 
advancements in early detection, better 
treatments and clinical trials, and also in 
disease prevention, ” she said.  
“But what I notice most is the consideration 
of a person’s individual needs as they change 
over time. It’s helping to ensure a good quality 
of life. Because once they are diagnosed, 
everything changes. It’s helping them figure 
out their new normal. ” Janaya Dwyer, Clinical Nurse Specialist
VICTORIA’S POPULA TION IN 2022
16From 1982 to 2021, the percentage of Victorian men 
aged 60 years or older increased from 12.4% to 20.9% 
and the percentage of men aged 70 years or older more 
than doubled from 5.1% to 10.8% (Figure 2A). For the 
same period, the percentage of Victorian women aged 
60 years or older increased from 16.1% to 23.3% and 
the percentage of Victorian women aged 70 years or 
older increased from 7.9% to 12.7% (Figure 2B).12

20 21NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES 
AMONG VICTORIANS
A snapshot of new cancer diagnoses 
in Victoria in 2022 
	98 Victorians are diagnosed with cancer every day. 
	For every 100 females diagnosed with cancer, 
there are 120 males diagnosed.  
	Cancer diagnoses in Victoria in 2022 are lower 
than in 2021, but higher than reported in 2020.
	About 6,660 fewer cancer diagnoses than 
expected were estimated by the end of 2022. 
	The most common cancers in Victoria are 
cancers of the prostate, breast, bowel, lung,  
and melanoma. These cancers account for 56% 
of all diagnoses in Victoria. 
	Aboriginal Victorians are twice as likely to  
be diagnosed with cancer than non-Aboriginal 
Victorians.   
	Melanoma diagnoses in regional Victoria  
are 47% higher than in major cities.  
On average, 98 Victorians are diagnosed  
with cancer every day.  
There were 35,656 Victorians diagnosed with cancer 
in 2022, of whom 19,419 (54.5%) were males and 
16,237 (45.5%) were females. In total 36,299 new 
cancers were registered in 2022, as 643 Victorians had 
more than one primary tumour diagnosed.
Cancer diagnoses declined in 2022 compared  
to 2021  
Traditionally, the annual number of new cancer 
diagnoses has risen in tandem with our expanding 
and growing population (Figure 4). Between 1990-
1994, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer 
increased by 3.5% per annum. This was followed by a 
period of stability between 1994-2000 before another 
period of significant increase between 2000-2007 
(+1.5% per annum, 95%CI: 0.5%, 2.5%). The past few 
years has seen a decline in new diagnoses. Notably, in 
2020 there was a 3.4% decline in the number of new 
cancer diagnoses compared to 2019, while in 2021, 
cancer diagnoses increased by 6.1% compared to 
2020 but remained below expected levels based on 
population growth and ageing. The age-standardised 
cancer incidence rate was 322 cases per 100,000 in 
2019, 303 cases per 100,000 in 2020, and 317 cases 
per 100,000 in 2021. In 2022, there was a 3.6% decline 
in the number of new cancer diagnoses compared to 
2021, with an age-standardised rate of 302 cases per 100,000. Using cancer diagnosis from 1982 to 2019 
and considering population trends, it is estimated  that 
the number of diagnoses for the period 2020-2022 
was 6,660 (95% CI: -6175, -7145) lower than expected. 
However, the calculations of missed diagnoses exclude 
estimates related to prostate cancer incidence, given the 
considerable variability in its historical trends.
As of 20 November 2023, no other population-based 
cancer registries have released 2022 cancer incidence 
data. While it is common for population-based cancer 
registries to project and estimate incidence rates, 
uncertainties in certain periods such as the COVID-19 
period, make accurate projections challenging. 
Therefore, the significance of the data presented 
in this report lies in its representation of actual new 
diagnoses in 2022. Given that Victoria experienced 
no restrictions on population movement in 2022, it 
potentially serves as a valuable benchmark for other 
jurisdictions and countries to use in comparison, 
offering a reliable reference point in the absence of 
finalised data from other registries. 
The decline in new cancer diagnoses seen in 2022 
may indicate that there are Victorians living in the 
community with an undiagnosed cancer which in 
previous years would have been reported to the 
Victorian Cancer Registry by now. The impact of 
this will require longer term analyses because many 
cancers progress slowly and delay may be unlikely to 
impact survival for many years and perhaps not at 
all. Yet, for other aggresive tumours, delay will require 
more extensive treatment and may result in higher 
mortality. An early indication of impact will be seen in 
monitoring the stage of cancer with which Victorians 
present and compare this with historical data. The 
decline in diagnoses may also, in part, reflect deaths 
among people who would otherwise have been 
diagnosed with cancer. In 2021, 0.8% of deaths in 
Australia were from COVID-19, rising to 9.6% of 
deaths during January and February 2022. 
Compared to 2021, the age-standardised incidence rate 
in 2022 declined by 4.7%. The age-standardised rate 
declined in males, from 352 cases per 100,000 in 2021 
to 335 cases per 100,000 in 2022. The age-standardised 
rate declined in females from 287 cases per 100,000 
in 2021 to 275 cases per 100,000 in 2022 (Figure 4).  
Compared to 2020, there were 809 more diagnoses 
(+2.3%) in 2022 but considering population growth 
and the ageing population, there was no significant 
difference in the age-standardised rate between 2020 
and 2022.   Figure 4:  Cancer incidence by sex, 1982-2022, with projected incidence to 2037 based on two models described

More males are diagnosed with cancer  
than females. 
Cancer is diagnosed in men at a ratio of 120 cases 
per 100 cases in females. Higher rates of cancer are 
reported for males in all cancers present in both 
males and females, except for cancer of the anus 
and anal canal (0.7 vs 1.2 cases per100,000), breast 
(0.6 vs 89 cases per100,000), and thyroid (5 vs 13 
cases per100,000). The largest difference in age-
standardised incidence rates between males and 
females is seen in cancer of the larynx (2.1 vs 0.3 cases 
per 100,000) and mesothelioma (1.7 vs 0.4 cases per 
100,000). This pattern of higher age-standardised 
incidence rates among males is seen later in life. 
Between the ages of 15 and 54 years, females are 
more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than males 
(Figure 5).   Figure 5: Age-specific incidence rates for all cancers,

of all cancers) for leading cancer types by sex in Victoria 2022 *Myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms (blood cancers).One in three males and one in four females  
will develop cancer by the age of 75.  
The cumulative risk of developing cancer by the  
age of 75 is 39.8% for males and 30.6% for females. The risk of developing common cancers by the age  
of 75 is outlined in Figure 6.  
In 2022, males accounted for 59% of cancer 
diagnoses in cancer affecting both men and women, excluding breast cancer. 
Cancer diagnoses increase with age and at  
a different rate between males and females.  
The median age for a cancer diagnosis is 70 years (interquartile range (IQR): 61, 77) for Victorian males and 67 years (IQR: 55, 77) for Victorian females.  The cancer rate for males aged 55 years and over  are 17 times higher than for males aged less than  55 years. The age-specific cancer rate for females aged 55 years is seven times higher than for females aged less than 55 years.   
Figure 5 shows age-specific incidence rates of 
Victorians diagnosed in 2022. After childhood, incidence increases steadily until age 45, after which time a steep increase in cancer diagnoses is seen among males. The incline in females begins earlier

Age at diagnosisProstate cancer among males and breast cancer 
among females are the most common cancers reported in those aged between 25 and 59 years.  
Cancer diagnoses increase 20 times between the 
ages 0-24 and 25-59 years, from 469 to 9,220 new diagnoses, with breast and prostate cancer being the most commonly diagnosed cancers in those aged between 25-59 years. 
Among females, breast cancer is more common  
than the next five cancers combined and accounts  for 40% of all new cancer diagnoses among females in the 25-59 year age group.    
The most common cancers in people aged 60 
and over are prostate, lung and breast cancer. 
In males diagnosed with cancer and aged 60 to 74 
years, prostate cancer constitutes 39%, followed by lung cancer at 9%, bowel cancer at 8%, and melanoma at 8%. 
Among males diagnosed with prostate cancer,  
58% are in males aged 60-74 years. For bowel  
cancer diagnoses in males, 19% occur in those  
aged  60-74 years, and for melanoma in males,  
39% of cases are in 60-74 age group. The age-specific 
incidence rate of lung cancer almost doubled in males aged 60-64, compared to those aged 55-59 years, from 62.4 to 106.9 cases per 100,000 (or from 116  
to 189 cases in 2022). Lung cancer rates continue  
to rise to a rate of 216.2 cases per 100,000 in males aged 70-74 years and to 376.9 cases per 100,000  
in males aged 80-84 years.   
In females diagnosed with cancer and aged 60-74 
years, breast cancer constitutes 29%, followed by  
lung cancer at 11%, bowel cancer at 9%, and melanoma at 7%. 
Among females diagnosed with breast cancer, 36% 
are in females aged 60 to 74 years. For lung cancer diagnoses in females, 21% occur in those aged between 60-74 years. For bowel cancer diagnoses in females, 15% occur in those aged  60-74 years, and for melanoma in females, 14% of cases are in 60-74 age group. Lung cancer rates are lower in females than for males, but this gap is narrowing (Figure 19).    Projecting cancer diagnoses is more difficult  
as a result of the COVID-19 years. 
Cancers are projected to increase, because Victorians 
are living longer, and cancer is generally a disease of older people. Projections are also influenced by previous improvement in early detection, treatment, and survivorship, which has resulted from scientific discovery. Finally, projections are influenced by population growth, or the movement of people into and out of Victoria. An unknown variable in determining projections is the impact of COVID-19, which has had an immediate and acute impact on cancer diagnoses. It will take some time to understand the impact of the rapid decline in cancer diagnoses, and population-based cancer registries will monitor this through incidence data, including stage of disease at diagnosis, and mortality data. T wo models have been used to project new diagnoses in this report:
– Model 1 considers that trends will change as a result
of the previous three years (COVID-19 period), and
– Model 2 has removed this period from analyses.Details are provided in T able 2 for both Model 1  
and 2, with the estimated number of new diagnoses in 
the period 2033-2037 ranging from 51,366 (95%CI: 49,889-53,023) to 56,523 (95%CI: 54,013-59,420). Details of how projections are calculated  
are outlined in Appendix 2.
The number of new cancer diagnoses are 
projected to increase for almost all cancers  
over the next 15 years.  
The increase in the absolute numbers of new 
diagnoses in the next 15 years depends on whether the 2020-2022 years, for which the number of new diagnoses is down compared to predicted cases using pre-COVID data, are included. Including 2020-2022 (model 1), diagnoses are estimated to increase by 48% in males and by 38% among females. These numbers assume that the downward trends in 2020-2022 will continue into the future. Excluding 2020-2022 (model 2), diagnoses are estimated to increase by 55% in males and by 57% among females. These numbers assume the missed diagnoses will present in the future (T able 2).

Aboriginal and T orres Strait 
Islander People*
Cancer disproportionately affects Aboriginal 
Victorians. In an effort to tackle this inequality, the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (VACCHO) has collaborated with various entities, including the Victorian Integrated Cancer Services, the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre Alliance, health services, and Regional Cancer Centres. T ogether, they have formulated the Victorian Aboriginal Cancer Journey Strategy, aiming to enhance cancer outcomes 
(15). The strategy is 
centered on self-determination, ensuring the delivery of high quality care in a manner that aligns with the cultural needs of Aboriginal Victorians. The Optimal Care Pathway for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES 
AMONG VICTORIANS
People with cancer, (16) provides a guiding framework 
to assess the quality of care delivered to Aboriginal 
Victorians diagnosed with cancer.   
Aboriginal Victorians are twice as likely  
to be diagnosed with cancer than non-
Aboriginal Victorians.   
In the period 2017-2021, on average 328 cancers 
were diagnosed in Aboriginal Victorians each year,  
172 in males and 156 in females. The age-standardised incidence rate of cancer among Aboriginal males was 736 cases per 100,000 and among Aboriginal females was 581 cases per 100,000. By comparison, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer among non-Aboriginal Victorian males was 354 cases per 100,000 and among non-Aboriginal females was 284 cases per 100,000 (Figure 10).  
Aboriginal Victorian males are more than twice as 
likely to be diagnosed with cancers of the liver, lung, and head and neck. Aboriginal Victorian females  
are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancers of the liver, lung, head and neck, lymphoma and leukaemia.     
The most common cancers for Aboriginal Victorians 
to be diagnosed with are lung, prostate, breast and bowel cancers. These cancers account for 47.3% of cancers among Aboriginal Victorians.  
Most cancers with diagnoses of at least 20 Aboriginal 
Victorians in the 2017-2021 period had significantly higher mean age-standardised incidence rates for both Aboriginal males and females. Of the most common cancers, differences in the mean age-standardised incidence rates were significantly higher for both Aboriginal males and females for cancers of the head and neck (2.7 times higher), bowel (1.9 times higher), liver (5.1 times higher), lung (4.3 times higher), lymphoma (1.8 times higher), and leukaemia (1.8 times higher).   
Aboriginal Victorian females also had significantly 
higher mean age-standardised incidence rates for cancers of the breast (1.5 times higher), vulva, vagina and other unspecified female genital organs (2.9 times higher), cervix (3.4 times higher) and uterus (2.0 times higher).

Regional Victorians are 10% more likely  
to be diagnosed with cancer than those living  
in major cities.   
In 2022, 10,837 regional Victorians were diagnosed 
with cancer. Between 2020-2022, there were approximately 6,212 males and 4,657 females living in regional Victoria diagnosed with cancer each year. Age-standardised rates of those living in regional Victoria are higher among males than females (371 NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES 
AMONG VICTORIANS
versus 295 cases per 100,000) (Figure 12). Both males 
and females living in regional Victoria have higher age-standardised rates of cancer than those residing in major Victorian cities.   
The most common cancers among regional Victorians 
are the same as urban Victorians: prostate, breast, bowel, lung and melanoma. Y et, age-standardised rates were significantly higher for both males and females residing in regional Victoria diagnosed with melanoma, leukaemia, bowel and lung cancer.    Regional Victorians are 47% more likely  
to be diagnosed with melanoma than those 
living in major cities.    
There were 1,050 regional Victorians diagnosed 
with melanoma in 2022. Regional Victorians have a significantly higher rate of diagnosis of melanoma than those living in major cities (36.4 versus 24.7 cases per 100,000 among males and 28.1 versus 17.1 cases per 100,000 among females) (Figure 12). Melanoma diagnoses were 63% higher among regional Victorians compared to Victorians who live in major cities. Melanomas account for about 10% of cancers among regional Victorians. Differences in age-standardised rates among males and females over time are shown in Figure 13.

Head and neck cancer diagnoses are 33% higher 
in regional males than urban males.   
There were 311 regional males and 121 regional 
females diagnosed with head and neck cancer in 2022. Regional Victorians have a significantly higher rate of diagnosis of head and neck tumours than urban Victorians (19.9 versus 14.7 cases per 100,000 among males and 6.3 versus 5.1 cases per 100,000 among females) (Figure 12). Head and neck cancer diagnoses were 33% higher among Victorians residing in regional Victoria compared to those in major cities in 2022. Differences in age-standardised rates of head and neck cancer between males living in major cities and in regional areas of Victoria have persisted over the past six years (Figure 14).

30 31Commonly Diagnosed Cancers 
Details of trends in cancer incidence can be seen for 
all cancers on the VCR website using the Data Explorer interactive portal (https://www.cancervic.org.au/research/vcr). Some details of commonly diagnosed cancers are described in this section. 
Prostate cancer 
Incidence and trend: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 16% of all cancers diagnosed in Victoria in 2022 and 29% of all cancers diagnosed in males. In 2022, there were 5,823 males diagnosed with prostate cancer, providing an age-standardised incidence rate of 98 new cases per 100,000 population. The median age at diagnosis is 69 years (IQR: 63-75) with a range from 33 to 102 years. Prostate cancer rates have fluctuated more than any other cancer in Victoria over the past three decades, with incidence rates mirroring trends in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test rates and shown in Figure 16A. 
Impact of COVID-19: In 2022, the observed new 
diagnoses exhibited a relative difference of -22% (95%CI: -18%, -26%) compared to the expected number of cases based on data from 2014-2019, translating to 1,622 fewer cases than anticipated. The decline was most pronounced in males aged 65-69 years (-21%, 95%CI: -13%, -29%) and 75-79 years (-25% [95%CI: -15%, -34%).   
Projections: Fluctuations in historical incidence rates 
make it very difficult to predict future rates (T able 2). 
Considering these uncertainties, it is projected that annual incidence in 2033-2037 will range from 8,002 to 9,866 or an age-standardised rate range from 102 to 118 cases per 100,000 males (T able 2).         
Stage at diagnosis: The International Society of 
Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group is used to indicate the histological patterns of prostate cancer based on the Gleason score, providing a standardised approach to assessing the aggressiveness of the cancer. A lower ISUP grade confers a survival advantage over higher ISUP grade groups. In Victoria in 2022, 26% of prostate cancer is diagnosed at ISUP grade group 1, 28% at ISUP grade group 2, 13% at ISUP grade group 3, 5% at ISUP grade group 4 and 13% at ISUP grade group 5. In 2022, 350 males (6%) were diagnosed with metastatic disease and for 464 males (8%) the grade group was unknown. Trend in ISUP grade group classification since 2010 is shown in Figure 16B.

Breast cancer  
Incidence and trend: Breast cancer is the second 
most common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 13% of all new cases diagnosed in 2022, 29% of all cancers diagnosed in females and 0.2% of cancers among males. There were 4,805 females and 45 males diagnosed in 2022, providing an age-standardised incidence rate of 89 new cases per 100,000 among females and 0.6 cases per 100,000 among males. The median age at diagnosis for females is 62 years (IQR: 51-73 ) and for males is 78 years (IQR: 67-83). Trends in age-standardised rates of breast cancer among females between 1982-2022 is shown in Figure 17A. 
Impact of COVID-19: In 2022, there were 472 (95%CI: 
-358, -585) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of breast cancer. The decline in new diagnoses relative to expected  in 2022 of 9% (95%CI: -6.8%, -11.1%) is more pronounced than in 2021 (-3.8%, 95%CI: -1.9%, -5.8%) but less than experienced in 2020 (-12.4%, 95%CI: -10.7%, -14.2%), when comparedFigure 16: Prostate cancer trend in (A) incidence, 1982-2022 with projections to 2037 based on two models described in Appendix 2 Statistical Methodology and B) ISUP grade group at diagnosis, 2010-2022, Victoria.   Figure 17: Trend in breast cancer (females only) (A) incidence, 1982-2022 with projections to 2037 based on two models described in Appendix 2 Statistical Methodology and B) registry-derived stage at diagnosis, 2010-2022, Victoria.to the number of expected cases based on trends in the 2006-2019 period. The decline was most pronounced in females aged 70-74 years (-19.5%, 95%CI: -12.9%, -26%). The cumulative deficit in breast cancer diagnoses for the period 2020-2022 is estimated to be 1,206 cases, reflecting a 7.9% decline.
Projections: In the next decade to 2033-2037, 
breast cancer age-standardised rates are anticipated to remain steady if COVID-impacted years are removed from the projection model (Model 2) or decline slightly if COVID-19 years are included in the model (Model 1) (Figure 17A). The actual number of breast cancer diagnoses in females is likely to increase to between 6,206-7,297 cases annually over the next 15 years  (T able 2). 
Stage at diagnosis: Trend in registry-derived 
stage of disease at diagnosis for the period 2010-2022 is shown in Figure 17B. Stage is calculated using registry-derived stage, with the methodology discussed in Appendix 2. Early-stage breast cancer is stage 1 or 2 and indicates that the cancer is contained in the breast or that growth has only extended to the nearby lymph nodes. Stage 3 breast cancer indicates that the tumour is locally advanced, it is larger than 5cm and has spread to tissues around the breast such as the skin, muscles or ribs, or has spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 4 breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body and is called advanced or metastatic disease. In 2022, 38% of breast cancer is diagnosed at stage 1, 37% at stage 2, 7% at Stage 3, 4% at stage 4, and for 14% of cases, stage could not be calculated.   
Bowel cancer  
Incidence and trend: Bowel, or colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 10% of all new cases diagnosed in both males and females in 2022. There were 3,504 new bowel cancer diagnoses in 2022: 1,814 (52%) in males and 1,690 (48%) in females, providing an age-standardised incidence rate of 31.0 new cases per 100,000 among males and 24.9 cases per 100,000 among females.  
The median age at diagnosis is 70 years (IQR: 58-80), with a slightly younger median age at diagnosis for males compared to females (69 [IQR: 58-78] vs 72 [IQR: 59-81] years respectively). Between 2012-2022, the age-standardised incidence rate for all ages decreased from 34.7 to 27.8 cases per 100,000 people (Figure 18A). For the period 2001-2019 the annual percent change in bowel cancer diagnoses was -1.6% (95%CI: -1.8%, -1.3%) in males. Among females, there has been a modest annual percent decline between 1992-2017 of 0.7% (95%CI: -0.9%, -0.5%). 
Impact of COVID-19: In 2022, there were 614 (95%CI: 
-537, -691) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of bowel cancer. The decline in new diagnoses relative to

32expected in 2022 of 15.1% (95%CI: -13.2%, -17.0%) 
is more pronounced than in both 2021 (-8.5%, 95%CI: -13.2%, -17.0%) and 2020 (-11.0%, 95%CI: -9.4%, -12.6%) when compared to the 2001-2019 period. The decline was seen equally among males and females. In total, in the period 2020-2022 there was an 11.9% (95%CI: -9.6%, -14.3%) decline in new bowel cancer diagnoses among males and an 11.1% (95%CI: -8.5%, -13.7%) decline in new diagnoses in females compared to the number of expected cases based on trends in the 2001-2019 period. The overall deficit of 1,399 fewer cases than expected, reflects an 11.5% decline across both males and females in the period 2020-2022 compared with historical trends between 2001-2019.
Projections: Bowel cancer rates are anticipated  
to increase over the next decade (T able 2 and Figure 
18A). Cases are projected to increase to 32.3 cases per 100,000 (Model 1) or 38.9 cases per 100,000 (Model 2). The number of bowel cancer diagnoses  
is projected to be between 4,567 - 5,757 cases annually over the next 15 years.
Stage at diagnosis: Bowel cancer stage at registry-
derived diagnosis is reasonably evenly distributed across the four groups, as seen in Figure 18B. In 2022, 21% of bowel cancer cases were diagnosed with stage 1 disease, 21% with stage 2 disease, 19% with stage 3 disease, 19% with stage 4 disease and for 21% of cases stage could not be derived. Comparing the distribution of bowel cancer diagnoses in 2022 and 2010, there is a 10% increase in the proportion  
of  cases diagnosed with stage 1 disease , a 3% decline in cases diagnosed with stage 2 disease,  
a 14% increase in the cases diagnosed with stage 4 disease, and a 7% decline in cases with no stage 
available over the last 12 years.NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES

Lung cancer  
Incidence and trend: Lung cancer is the fourth  most 
common cancer in Victoria, accounting for 9% of 
all new cases diagnosed in 2022 among both males 
and females. Ther e were 1,776 (54%) males and 
1,493 (45%) females diagnosed, providing an age-
standardised incidence rate of 26.8 cases per 1 00,000 
among males and 21.1 cas es per 100,000 among 
females. The median age at diagnosis is 72 years  
(IQR: 64-79). Between 2010-2022, the age-
standardised incidence rate of lung cancer has been 
declining at an average rate of 1.2% (95%CI: -1.8%, 
0.6%) in males. For femal es between 1982-2020, the 
age-standardised incidence rate increased at an 
average of 1.2% (95%CI: 1.1%, 1.3%)  annually and 
then, between 2020-2022 declined at an average 
annual percent change of 3.4% (95%CI: -10.4%, 
4.1%) (Figure 19).     
Impact of C OVID-19:  In 2022, ther e were 468 
(95%CI: -254, -681) fewer than anticipated new 
diagnoses of lung cance r. The decline in new 
diagnoses relative to expected in 2022 of 12.8% 
(95%CI: -6.9%, -18.6%) i s more pronounced than Figure 19: Trend in lung cancer incidence, 1982-

The decline was seen equally among males and females. In total, in the period 2020-2022 there was a 9.0% (95%CI: -2.8%, -15.2%) decline in new lung cancer diagnoses among males and a 7.8% (95%CI: -0.5%, -15%) decline in new diagnoses in females compared to the number of expected cases based on trends in the 2015-2019 period. The overall deficit of 890 fewer cases than expected, reflects an 8.4% decline across both males and females in the period 2020-2022 compared with historical trends between 2015-2019.
Projections: Long-term trends show a plateauing of 
lung cancer incidence among both males and females (Figure 19). In the period 2033-2037, lung cancer cases are projected to remain steady at 24.9 cases per 100,000 (Model 1) or increase to 26.1 cases per 100,000 (Model 2) (T able 2).

Melanoma  
Incidence and trend: Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in Victoria. In 2022, 2,885 Victorians were diagnosed with melanoma (1,697 males and 1,188 females), accounting for 8% of all new cases diagnosed in 2022 (8.6% of all cancers diagnosed in males and 7.2% in females). The age-standardised incidence rate was 29 cases per 100,000 among males and 19 cases per 100,000 among females. The median age at diagnosis is 69 years (IQR: 58-77). Between 1996-2018, there has been no annual percent change in new melanoma diagnoses. An annual percent decline of 4.2%  was seen between 2018-2022, incorporating the COVID-19 years. The trend in melanoma incidence is outlined in Figure 20A. “If this was 20 years ago, Isla would’ve  
died. The research that’s been done  
in that time means that we could  
go through without those thoughts. ”  
Isla was diagnosed with leukaemia when she 
was three years old. The first visible sign that 
something was wrong was the appearance of a small lump on her head that progressively grew. 
“After about three months of going around in 
circles, we decided to go straight to emergency 
to see if we could get some answers, ” says, Pam. 
“Within about an hour or so we found out that 
she had leukaemia. So, from there we were straight up to the ward and that’s when the 
journey started for us. ” 
Isla was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL), which affects around 121 
Victorians each year, including 65 children under 
15 years.  
After months of uncertainty, Pam was relieved 
to finally have a diagnosis. “I just remember that feeling of ‘now it starts, now we do what we need to do to get through it, ’” she said. 
Isla was placed on a course of steroids, 
chemotherapy, and antibiotics, taking as many as 20 pills a day. She would also go to hospital 
for intravenous chemotherapy and lumbar 
punctures and stay for lengthy periods. 
T wo-and-a-half years after her diagnosis, 
including nine months of intensive treatment, the medical staff rang the bell at the conclusion 
of Isla’s final dose of chemotherapy. But for Pam and Gareth, there is still an anxious two-year 
window where relapse is possible. 
“It’s not done, not in my brain. I’ve still got 
another 18 months before it’s done. So, it’s always sitting back there, ” said Pam. Pam Moore, Isla Moore’s mum

34 35Projections: Uterine cancer age-standardised 
incidence rates are projected to continue to 
decline over the next 15 years (Figure 21A). Uterine age-standardised rates are estimated to range from between 16.4 to 17.7 cases per 100,000 in 2033-2037, while new diagnoses are expected to increase by between 36-46% over the next decade, depending on whether or not COVID-19 period is included in projection models.   
Stage of disease at diagnosis: Registry-derived 
stage was developed for endometrial cancer, excluding other sub-categories of uterine cancers because of differing definitions and survival rates between endometrial and non-endometrial malignancies of the uterus. For endometrial cases diagnosed in 2022, 4% were unstageable. Therefore, of those with stage reported,  77% were diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 disease, 15% with stage 3 disease and 8% with stage 4 disease (Figure 21B).NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES

Impact of COVID-19. In 2022, there were 413 (95%CI: -347, -478) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of melanoma. The decline in new diagnoses relative to expected in 2022 of 12.5% (95%CI: -10.5%, -14.5%) is similar to 2021 (-11.4%, 95%CI: -9.5%, -13.3%) but less pronounced than reported in 2020 (-17.0%, 95%CI: -15.3%, -18.8%). There was a similar decline among males and females. In total, in the period 2020-2022 there was a 13.2% (95%CI: -10.7%, -15.7%) decline in new melanoma diagnoses among males and a 14.2% (95%CI: 11.4%, -17.0%) decline in new diagnoses in females compared to expected numbers based on trends in the 1996-2019 period. The overall deficit of 1,311 fewer cases than expected, reflects an13.6% decline across both males and females in the period 2020-2022 compared with historical trends between1996-2019. 
Projections: Melanoma age-standardised incidence 
rates are projected to continue to decline for both 
males and females over the next 15 years (Figure 20A). Melanoma age-standardised rates are estimated to range from between 20.9 to 30.6 cases per 100,000 in 2033-2037 while new diagnoses are expected to increase by between 24-69% over the next decade, depending on whether or not COVID-19 period is included in projection models (T able 2).  
Stage of disease at diagnosis: In 2022, 71% of 
melanomas were diagnosed as stage 1 cancers, 21% with stage 2 disease, 2% with stage 3 disease and 3% were diagnosed with stage 4 disease. For 3% of cases, the stage at diagnosis was unable to be derived or captured from hospital notifications. Over the past five years, there has been a slight decline in the percent of cases diagnosed annually with stage 1 disease (75% to 71%) while the number of cases diagnosed with stage 2 disease has increased from 14% to 21% (Figure 20B).

Uterine (endometrial) cancer 
Incidence and trend: Uterine cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer among Victorian females and the 5th most commonly diagnosed tumour in females in 2022. The endometrium refers  
to the lining of the uterus and accounts for 95%  
of all uterine tumours. In 2022, 813 Victorian females were diagnosed with uterine cancer, providing  
an age-standardised rate of 14.4 cases per 100,000.  
The median age at diagnosis is 65 years (IQR: 56-73). Incidence of uterine cancer has been increasing at an average rate of 0.9% (95%CI: 0.8%, 1.1%) annually since 1982 (Figure 21A).   
Impact of COVID-19. In 2022, there were 77 (95%CI: 
-55, -102) fewer than anticipated new diagnoses of uterine cancer. The decline in new diagnoses relative toexpected in 2022 of 8.6% (95%CI: -5.8%, -11.5%) was more pronounced than in 2021 (-0.9%, 95%CI: 1.8%, -3.6%) but less than reported in 2020 (-10.6%, 95%CI:-8.0%, -13.2%) when compared to the number of expected cases based on trends in the1982-2019 period.

AMONG VICTORIANS
A snapshot of cancer mortality  
in Victoria in 2022 
	In Victoria, 32 people die from cancer every  
day, and more males die from cancer than 
females.  
	The cancer mortality rate has decreased  
2.2% per year since 1995 in men and 1.6%  
per year since 1993 in women.   
	Aboriginal Victorians are more than 3 times 
more likely to die from cancer than non-
Aboriginal Victorians. 
	The leading causes of cancer death are cancers 
of the lung, bowel, pancreas, prostate and 
breast which together account for just over  
half of all deaths.   
Cancer is the leading cause of death in Victoria. 
In 2022, cancer was the cause of about 27% of 
deaths in Victoria. There were 47,978 registered 
deaths in Victoria, providing an age-standardised 
rate of 541 deaths per 100,000 Victorians.17 Cancer 
was the leading cause of death, followed by diseases 
of the circulatory system (e.g. ischemic heart disease, heart, stroke, other cardiac conditions) and the 
respiratory system. In 2022, COVID-19 accounted  
for 2,955 deaths among Victorians.17    
Y ears of potential life lost – a measurement of 
premature death – is calculated by subtracting the 
age at a person’s death from that of a ‘standard life’ , 
which is calculated as being 75 years by the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics.18 Victorian Cancer Registry data 
estimates that cancer will account for 63,628 years  
of life lost prematurely in 2022.   
32 people die from cancer every day.  
In 2022, 11,829 Victorians died from cancer, including 
6,576 males and 5,253 females.  
More males die from cancer than females.  
Males account for 56% of cancer-related deaths.  
For cancers common in both males and females (and 
excluding breast cancer), males account for 59% of 
deaths. In 2022, the median age at death following  
a diagnosis of cancer was 76 years (IQR: 67-84).  
The number of cancer-related deaths is increasing 
in Victoria due to a growing and ageing population. 
However, as an age-standardised rate, cancer-related 
deaths are declining (Figure 22).For males, the age-standardised mortality rate has 
declined at a steady annual rate of 0.5% between 
1982-1995 and at a more rapid annual rate of 2.2% 
between 1995-2022. The age-standardised mortality 
rate has declined from 169 deaths per 100,000 in 
1982, to 138 deaths per 100,000 in 2002, to 110 
deaths per 100,000 in 2012 to 90 deaths per 100,000 
reported in 2022.     
For females, the age-standardised mortality rate 
has also declined over the past four decades but at a 
more modest rate and from a lower baseline. Between 
1982-1993, an average annual percent change 
of -0.1% was reported. Between 1993-2022, the 
average annual decline increased to 1.6%. The age-
standardised mortality rate has declined from 106 
deaths per 100,000 in 1982, to 93 deaths per 100,000 
in 2002, to 77 deaths per 100,000 in 2012 and to 65 
deaths per 100,000 in 2022.  
The declining mortality rate is the result of 
improvements in cancer prevention, diagnosis, 
and treatment. This includes improved recognition 
of symptoms prompting diagnosis, increasing 
availability and uptake of screening and case-
finding, improvement in delivery of health services, 
and discoveries such as targeted drug therapies.  
The mortality rate of most cancers is projected to 
decline over the next 15 years. 
Over the next 15 years, it is projected that male 
cancer mortality rates will continue to decline, with 
the two projection models demonstrating little 
impact of deaths in 2033-2037 (T able 4). Uterine 
cancers age-standardised deaths are predicted to 
increase from 2.2 to between 2.4 and 3.2 deaths per 
100,000 population by 2033-2037. Prostate cancer 
age-standardised rates may increase, but this is 
difficult to predict given the volatility in prostate 
cancer incidence and mortality data over the 
previous decades (T able 4).   
The highest cancer mortality rates are in people 
aged 75 and over. 
The highest percentage of deaths is seen in Victorians 
aged 75-84 years (32%), with deaths distributed 
evenly among those aged 85 years or older (24%) 
and between 65-74 years (24%). Distribution of the 
11,829 deaths across age groups is displayed in Figure 
23. In 2022, there were 305 cancer-related deaths in 
Victorians under 45, accounting for just 2.6% of all 
cancer deaths.  Actual Projected

44 45CANCER MORT ALITY AMONG VICTORIANS
In 2022, over 63,000 years of potential life  
was lost to cancer in Victoria.  
Y ears of potential life lost – a measurement of 
premature death – is calculated by subtracting the 
age at a person’s death from that of a ‘standard life,’ 
which is calculated as being 75 years by the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics.18  
The cancers responsible for the highest number 
of potential years lost among males are those of 
the lung, bowel, brain and central nervous system, 
pancreas, and liver (Figure 25). T ogether they account 
for 17,170 years lost or 53% of the 32,451 years lost 
because of all cancer among males in 2022.  
Among females, the cancers responsible for the 
highest number of potential years lost are those of the 
breast, lung, bowel, brain and central nervous system, 
and pancreas. T ogether they accounted for 18,487 
years lost, or 59% of the 31,177 years lost because  
of all cancer among females.   Cancers of the blood, brain and central 
nervous system are responsible for most 
deaths among children 
In Victoria in 2022, there were 28 deaths in 
children aged 0-14 years. Because of the low rate 
of cancer diagnoses and deaths among children, 
cancer data among Victorians aged under 15 
years contributes to the Australian Childhood 
Cancer Registry where data is used to produce and 
publish statistical information about childhood 
cancer in Australia.19 This information is used to 
facilitate research to better understand the causes 
of childhood cancers and improve outcomes for 
children with cancer.  
Data from the Australian Childhood Cancer  
Registry indicates that cancer mortality in 
children aged less than 15 years is rare and  
is declining. Overall childhood cancer mortality 
rates in Australia decreased by an average  
of 2.9% per year between 1998 and 2019,  
a total decrease of 46% based on the modelled 
estimates. Mortality rates from childhood 
leukaemia declined by 58% in the period  
1998-2007 and have since remained stable.  
The percent distribution of cancer deaths  
by age group, with associated number of deaths 
is shown in Figure 26 for males and Figure 27  
for females.

most deaths among those aged 15-49 years  
Among Victorians aged less than 50 years, breast 
cancer was responsible for most deaths among 
females and bowel cancer among males. There were 
70 deaths from breast cancer and 78 deaths from 
bowel cancer in this age group. These are discussed 
further in the Cancers with higher mortality rates section

Age at diagnosisLung, bowel, pancreatic, prostate and breast 
cancer took more lives than any others in 
Victorians aged over 50 years.  
In 2022, there were 2,155 deaths for lung cancer, 
1,229 deaths from bowel cancer, 896 deaths 
from pancreatic cancer, 848 deaths from prostate 
cancer and 669 deaths from breast cancer among 
Victorians aged over 50 years. T ogether these five 
cancers accounted for 30% of deaths in Victorians 
aged over 50 years.  
46 47Aboriginal and T orres Strait  
Islander People* 
Aboriginal Victorians are more than three  
times more likely to die from cancer than  
non-Aboriginal Victorians.  
For the period 2017-2021, Aboriginal males were 
3.3 times more likely to die from cancer than non-
Aboriginal males. Aboriginal females were 3.1 times 
more like to die from cancer than non-Aboriginal 
females (Figure 28). From 2017 to 2021, there were 
321 cancer deaths in Aboriginal Victorian males and 
264 in Aboriginal Victorian females.    
The age-standardised mortality rate among 
Aboriginal males was 289 deaths per 100,000 
compared with 89 deaths per 100,000 in non-
Aboriginal males, and in Aboriginal females was 
203 deaths per 100,000 compared with 63 deaths 
per 100,000 in non-Aboriginal females. A fully 
implemented Victorian Aboriginal Cancer Journey 
Strategy15 with culture embedded in care and 
consideration of the political, social and historical 
determinants of health, will lead to increased 
access and participation in cancer screening and

early detection initiatives as well as increased 
engagement in care that will meet the needs of each 
Aboriginal family. 
Among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in 
Aboriginal Victorians, both males and females are 
more than twice as likely to die from cancers of the 
oesophagus, lung, and liver, than other Victorians 
(Figure 28). 
Aboriginal Victorian males are more likely to die from 
cancer of the liver (5.2 times), lung (4.5 times), and 
oesophagus (4.7 times) than non-Aboriginal Victorian 
males. 
Aboriginal Victorian females are more likely than non-
Aboriginal Victorian females to die from cancer of the 
liver (5.4 times), lung (4.6 times), and leukaemia (4.6 
times). Mortality from cervical cancer, one of the few 
highly preventable cancers, is 7.3 times higher among 
Aboriginal Victorian females than non-Aboriginal 
females (SIR: 733, ASR 6.4 [95%CI: 2.6, 13.7] vs 0.9 
[95%CI: 0.8, 1.0]). With the introduction of universal 
self-collection for cervical screening, Aboriginal 
women and people with a cervix have increasingly 
participated in cervical screening, including those that 
are underscreened. 
 *Aboriginal Victorians in this report refers to Aboriginal and/or T orres Strait islander peoples in VictoriaThe median age at death for an Aboriginal 
Victorian diagnosed with cancer is 67 years 
compared to 76 years among non-Aboriginal 
Victorians. 
There is a nine-year difference in median age at death 
between Aboriginal Victorians and non-Aboriginal 
Victorians. Figure 29 shows age-specific mortality 
curves for Victorian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal 
males and females for the five-year period 2017 to 
2021. Differences in cancer mortality progressively 
become more pronounced with increasing age for 
both males and females.  The Beautiful Shawl Project is a joint effort led by the Community, aiming to offer secure and empowering 
breast screening encounters for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women. It presents a culturally 
sensitive and responsive alternative for conventional screening. The initiative involves supplying 
personalised screening shawls to Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women, designed to be culturally 
fitting, recognisable, and aesthetically pleasing to wear during their breast screening. These shawls,  
crafted by talented local Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women and artists, are given as gifts  
to take home following the screening process. See https://www.vaccho.org.au/beautiful-shawl-project/

48 49Regional Victorians 
Regional Victorians are 16% more likely  
to die from cancer than those who reside  
in major cities.  
For the period 2020-2022, regional dwelling 
males were 16% more likely and regional dwelling 
females were 13% more likely than their major 
city counterparts to die from cancer (Figure 30). 
Among cancers commonly diagnosed in males, this difference was seen in ill-defined tumours (98% 
higher), melanoma (65% higher) and cancer of the 
oesophagus (55% higher), prostate (35% higher), 
bowel (16% higher), head and neck (21% higher), lung 
(12% higher), and leukaemia (23% higher) (Figure 
30). Among commonly diagnosed cancers in females, 
those residing in regional areas were more likely to 
die from cancer of the bowel (37% higher), lung (31% 
higher), ovary (37% higher), melanoma (42% higher), 
and from cancer of unknown primary site (45% higher).

The median age at death for a Victorian living  
in regional Victoria with cancer is similar  
to those living in major cities. 
Age-specific mortality rates are comparable for 
Victorian males and females, regardless of whether 
they reside in regional areas or in major cities

cancers are described in this section. 
Lung cancer 
Mortality and trend: Lung cancer is the leading 
cause of cancer-related deaths in Victoria, being 
responsible for causing the deaths of 2,205 
Victorians in 2022. In 2022, 1,252 males and 953 
females died from lung cancer, accounting for 
19% of all cancer-related deaths. The median age 
at death was 75 years (IQR: 67-82). In 2022, the 
age-standardised mortality rate was 17.6 deaths 
per 100,000 males and 11.6 deaths per 100,000 
females (Figure 32). Among males, lung cancer age-
standardised mortality rates declined at an annual 
percent change of 0.7% during the period 1982-
1989 and then a more rapid annual decline of 2.9% 
was seen between 1989-2022. Among females there 
was a steady annual increase in mortality of 1.9% 
between 1982-1994, after which a modest annual 
decline in age-standardised mortality was seen of 
0.2% between 1994-2015. Over the past eight years 
(2015-2023), the annual percent decline in mortality 
rates among females has accelerated to 2.3%. This 
variation is likely the result of historical differences 
in smoking behavior, with smoking rates in men 
decreasing since the 1960s but rates in females not 
decreasing until the 1970s.20     
Projections: Data released by the Australian 
Institute of Health and Welfare indicates that 11.2% Figure 31: Age-specific cancer mortality rates

to 62% in 2019. These statistics support modelling, 
which indicates that lung cancer mortality will 
continue to decline over the next 15 years (Figure 
32). Age-standardised mortality rates are expected 
to decline to a rate of between 12.2 and 13 deaths 
per 100,000 in 2033-2037. The lower rate of 12.2

CANCER MORT ALITY AMONG VICTORIANS
50 51Bowel cancer 
Mortality and trend: Bowel cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Victoria, 
responsible for causing the deaths of 1,307 Victorians 
in 2022. In 2022, 697males and 610 females died 
from bowel cancer, accounting for 11% of all cancer-
related deaths. The median age at death in males was 
75 years (IQR: 66-84) and females was 78 years (IQR: 
66-87). In 2022, the age-standardised mortality rate 
was 10.0 deaths per 100,000 males and 7.3 deaths 
per 100,000 females (Figure 33). 
Among males, bowel cancer age-standardised 
mortality rates between 2009-2022 declined at an 
annual rate of 3.9%. Among females, the decline 
in bowel cancer mortality has been occurring at a 
steady rate of 2.3% annually since 1982. The overall 
decline in bowel cancer age-standardised mortality 
rates seen in Victoria is likely the result of changing 
patterns in bowel cancer risk factors, improvements in 
cancer treatment, and opportunistic colorectal cancer 
screening since the 1990s, as well as a phased rollout 
of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program from 
2006.22   
Projections: The number of Victorians dying from 
bowel cancer is expected to increase over the next 
15 years, yet age-standardised mortality rates are 
expected to decline or remain constant over this 
period (T able 4). The uncertainty in projecting bowel 
cancer mortality rates indicates the impact of the 
2020-2022 years on bowel cancer incidence and 
mortality for males.

Mortality and trend: Pancreatic cancer is the third 
leading cause of cancer-related death in Victoria. In 
2022, 917 Victorians died from pancreatic cancer – 
475 males and 442 females, accounting for 8% of all 
cancer-related deaths. In 2022, the age-standardised 
mortality rate was 6.6 deaths per 100,000 males and 
5.2 deaths per 100,000 females (Figure 34). Despite 
the relatively low number of cases diagnosed each 
year, it is the fifth leading cause of potential years of 
life lost, after lung, bowel, breast, brain and central 
nervous system cancer. Because of its poor prognosis, 
nearly the same number of people die from pancreatic 
cancer as are diagnosed with the disease. The high 
mortality rate of pancreatic cancer is the result of the 
disease only manifesting in its late stage. Currently, 
no screening test exists to detect the cancer before 
symptoms develop. For the period 1982-2022, age-
standardised mortality rates have been declining 
steadily at an average annual percent of 0.3% among 
males and increasing steadily at an average annual 
rate of 0.2% in females.   
Projections: Pancreatic cancer deaths are expected 
to remain constant at an age-standardised rate of 
between 5.3 and 5.6 deaths per 100,000 in the next 
15 years (T able 4).

Mortality and trend: Breast cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer deaths in females. It is 
responsible for 14% of deaths in females. In 2022, 
731 females and 8 males died from breast cancer. The 
median age at death in females was 72 years (IQR: 
60-83). In 2022, the age-standardised mortality rate 
was 10.3 deaths per 100,000 females (Figure 35). 
Breast cancer mortality declined at an annual rate 
of 0.2% between 1982-1991. Between 1991-2022, 
the age-standardised mortality rate from breast 
cancer declined steadily at an average annual rate of 
2.4%. The reduction in breast cancer mortality over 
the past three decades reflects a reduction in breast 
cancer risk (such as breastfeeding for longer duration), 
earlier detection of palpable tumours, and use of 
adjuvant systemic therapy, such as T amoxifen and 
polychemotherapy, which have been widely used after 
surgery since the late 1980s.23   
Projections: Breast cancer deaths are expected to 
increase over the next 15 years as a result of the 
growing and ageing population, despite the age-
standardised mortality rate projected to decline to 
a rate of between 8.4 and 9.6 deaths per 100,000 in 
2033-2037 (T able 4).

Mortality and trend: Prostate cancer is the third 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Victoria, 
being responsible for causing the deaths of 852 
Victorian males in 2022. It accounted for 13% of all 
cancer-related deaths in males. The median age 
at death was 83 years (IQR: 75-88). In 2022, the 
age standardised mortality rate was 9.6 deaths per 
100,000 males (Figure 36). Among males, prostate 
cancer age-standardised mortality rates have 
fluctuated over the past four decades. Prostate cancer 
age-standardised mortality rates increased between 
1982-1994 at an average percent change of 1.9%. 
This was followed by a period of decline in deaths, 
from 1994–2010 at an average rate of 2.1% and then 
more rapidly between 2010–2014 at 7.2%. Over the 
past 8 years (2014–2022), prostate cancer deaths 
have declined at a steady annual rate of 1.1%. This 
fluctuation reflects change in case finding of prostate 
cancer by prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and 
subsequent prostate biopsies for elevated levels.   
Projections: Prostate cancer mortality is difficult to 
project given the long-term fluctuation in incidence 
and the recent changes seen during the COVID-19 
period. Estimates indicate that the age-standardised 
mortality rate will be between 6.9 and 9.7 deaths per 
100,000 in 2033-2037 (T able 4).

AMONG VICTORIANS
A snapshot of cancer survival  
in Victoria in 2022 
	The 5-year survival rate for Victorians 
diagnosed with cancer has increased  
49% over the past 30 years. 
	 Across all cancers, the 5-year survival rate  
is 73% for females and 70% for males.  
	 Survival rates vary significantly across cancer 
types and are also impacted by factors such 
as age, socioeconomic position, Aboriginal 
or T orres Strait Islander identity, geographic 
location of residence, and the cancer stage  
at time of diagnosis.
Throughout this chapter we refer to ‘relative survival’ , 
which refers to the survival of a person with cancer 
compared with the expected survival for a person  
of the same age and sex living in Victoria during  
the same period. This is further explained in 
Appendix 2: Statistical Methodology. When referring 
to five-year survival the reader should assume five-
year relative survival.     
Five-year survival after a cancer diagnosis  
has, for the first time, reached 70% in men.   
In Victoria, the five-year survival rate across all cancers is 
71% (73% for females and 70% for males). (Figure 37).  
Figure 37: Trend in five-year relative survival for all cancers by year of diagnosis, Victoria 1982-2021  Figure 38 provides a summary of change in five-year 
survival across three time periods for solid tumours: 
1982-1986, then 1997-2001, and the most recent 
period from 2017-2021. Figure 54 in this year's report 
dedicated to blood cancers illustrates the change in 
five-year survival for this group of cancers over the 
same period.
Figure 38 shows that five-year relative survival rates 
for cancer in the most recent period vary from 10% for 
mesothelioma to 98% for testicular cancer and that 
survival rates continue to improve for most  
solid tumours.
For solid cancers that occur in females and males, 
the five-year survival rate is highest for thyroid 
cancer (95%), melanoma (94%), and lowest for 
mesothelioma (10%), pancreatic cancer (14%) and 
cancer of unknown primary site (17%). For males,  
the five-year survival rate is highest for testicular 
cancer (98%), prostate cancer (95%) and melanoma 
(92%), and lowest for mesothelioma (9%), pancreatic 
cancer (14%) and cancers of unknown primary site 
(18%). For females, the five-year survival is highest 
for thyroid (97%), melanoma (96%), and breast 
cancer (92%) and lowest for mesothelioma (13%), 
pancreatic cancer (15%) and cancers of unknown 
primary site (16%). 
The five-year survival rate for Victorians 
diagnosed with cancer has increased 22%  
over the past 20 years and 49% over the past  
30 years.
Between 1997-2001 and 2017-2021, the five-year 
survival rate has increased from 59% to 71%. Among 
females it has increased from 62% to 73%, and for 
males it has increased from 55% to 70% (Figure 37). 
When compared to five-year survival rates three 
decades ago (1987-1991 to 2017-2021), it has 
increased from 48% to 71%. Survival improvements 
reflect earlier detection, driven in part by screening 
programs, and advances in treatment. It is expected 
that the percentage of people living beyond five years 
after a diagnosis will continue to increase.   
Change in survival over the past 20 years has 
varied across the tumour types.        
For most blood and solid cancers, there has been 
significant improvement in five-year survival over 
the past two decades. The most pronounced Figure 38: Five-year relative survival rates for common solid tumours in Victoria, showing change between 
1982-1986, 1997-2001 and 2017-2021.  Cancers marked with an * show change between the period 1997-
2001 to 2017-2021
improvement in survival is seen in subgroups of blood 
cancers, described in detail in the ‘Focus’ section of 
this report.    
Among solid tumours over the past 20 years 
(comparing periods 1997-2001 and 2017-2021), 
improvement in five-year survival is seen across all solid 
tumours other than bladder, mesothelioma, cancers 
of connective tissue, other skin, cervix, uterus, and 
testis. The most significant improvement in absolute 
five-year cancer survival has been in cancer of the 
small intestine (20%, 48% to 68%), lung (16%, 13% 
to 29%), kidney (18%, 63% to 82%) and liver (16%, 
12% to 29%). In terms of relative change in five-year 
survival over this same period, we have seen greatest 
improvement in relative five-year survival in cancers of 
the pancreas (138%), liver (134%) and lung (130%).
Over the past 35 years (comparing period 1982-
1986 and 2017-2021), improvement is seen in all 
tumour streams other than mesothelioma, and 
tumours of the brain and central nervous system,

in absolute change in five-year survival among solid

anal canal (31%, 40% to 71%). Y et, the greatest 
improvement in relative change in five-year survival 
was in cancer of the liver (451%), lung (167%), and 
pancreas (160%).  
Among females, there has been a decline in absolute 
five-year survival over the past 20 years (comparing 
periods 1997-2001 and 2017-2021) for those 
diagnosed with vulval cancers (-6%, from 59% 
[95%CI: 53-65%] to 53% [95%CI: 50-56%]) although 
this has not reached a statistical level of significance. 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified in

cancer.24 Primary prevention through HPV vaccination 
is showing promising results in reducing HPV-
associated vulvar cancers.25  Early detection will have 
the greatest impact on survival and, in the absence of 
a specific screening test, relies upon self-examination 
and early evaluation of patients with signs and 
symptoms of vulvar disease. 
Five-year survival is increasing across  
all age groups.   
Five-year survival is impacted by age at diagnosis 
(Figure 39). Nearly all cancer types showed decreasing 
five-year survival with increasing age. However, the 
magnitude of the decline varies between cancer types. 
For example, for females aged 75 years and over, 
ovarian cancer survival is 23%, compared to 60% for 
females under 75, and breast cancer survival is 84%, 
compared to 94% for females under 75.

impacting life expectancy.

most marked in those aged between 45 and 64

Community Controlled Health Organisation released 
the Victorian Aboriginal Health and Wellbeing

of a cancer strategy aimed at addressing existing

of the Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander workforce 
while enhancing the capacity of the non-Aboriginal 
workforce to deliver culturally safe and effective 
services. Prioritising cultural strength, the strategy

health and wellbeing services. Furthermore, the 
workforce strategy champions the principles of self-
determination, empowering Aboriginal people to 
own their health and wellbeing and devise targeted, 
localised solutions to workforce planning. By fostering 
a sense of safety and support within health services, 
these principles are anticipated to enhance cancer 
outcomes for Aboriginal individuals.
Figure 41 demonstrates that five-year survival 
following a diagnosis of bowel cancer is significantly 
worse for Aboriginal Victorians compared with 
non-Aboriginal Victorians. Implementing targeted 
strategies to enhance bowel cancer screening and 
diagnosis within the Aboriginal Community aims to 
secure earlier disease detection, thereby positively 
influencing survival rates. Regional Victorians 
The five-year survival rate is impacted by 
where someone lives.  
Five-year survival is higher in residents of major 
Victorian cities (72%) compared to those in 
regional Victoria (69%), incorporating inner 
regional, outer regional and remote Victoria as 
shown in Figure 42. A map detailing geographical 
areas of Victoria is shown in Figure 1 of this report. 
Potential explanations for variation in relative 
survival include the types of cancers distributed 
in regions, the stage at which the cancers are 
detected, and the burden of risk factors among 
the population. Socio-economic differences have 
been associated with lower survival.27 Others have

and major cities of Victoria, 2017-2021.postulated that it may be driven, in part,  
by diagnostic delays, due to difficulty in accessing 
medical practitioners and fewer diagnostic 
facilities.28 Regional cancer centres and 
integrated cancer services continue to invest  
in strategies to lead local implementation of 
cancer reforms and provide world class cancer 
services as close to home as is safe  
and practicable.      
The most notable contrast in survival is observed 
within the age group of 55-64 years, coinciding  
with the population eligible for bowel and breast 
cancer screening, as well as case finding for 
prostate cancer.

64George Kiossoglou, living beyond leukaemia 
“The five-year survival rate for the 
particular sub-type I had – which was AML 
with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities 
– was five to 10 per cent. So, I consider 
myself really fortunate. ”
At 66, George’s volunteer work has become like 
a ‘second career’ for him, which was driven by his 
experience with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).  
“I’m around because of research. I’m around 
because of people who identified the BCL2 gene, 
who developed the machine that did the stem 
cell transplants, and I thought ‘I need to give 
back’ and this felt right, ” he said. 
10 years after surviving aggressive AML, George 
volunteers with various hospitals, research 
institutions and organisations as a consumer 
advisor, committee member, and more, including 
at Walter and Eliza Hall institute (WEHI), VCCC 
Alliance, and Royal Melbourne Hospital. 
It was an allogeneic stem cell transplant, with 
stem cells donated by his brother Nick, that 
ultimately saved George’s life. 70 per cent of 
his original stem cells were replaced with those 
produced by his brother.  
Post-transplant, George experienced five cases 
of ‘graft versus host disease’ (GVHD), where his 
original stem cells were attacked by those of his 
brother’s, viewing them as a threat. 
“All have been reasonably mild, ” said George. 
“They’ve been either the skin, the liver, twice 
on the kidney, and the gut. The kidney was the 
most life threatening, the gut was the worst. ”  
Now, 10 years on, George still lives with the 
effects of his illness – from constant tests to a 
plethora of medications to manage ongoing side 
effects and symptoms. But through volunteering 
for the very health centres responsible for saving 
his life, George is managing his ‘new normal’ with 
a renewed sense of purpose by devoting himself 
to their important work. Five-year survival rates among regional Victorians do 
not surpass those of Victorians living in major cities 
for any cancers. Y et, five-year survival rates for solid 
tumours are significantly lower for regional Victorians 
in cancers of the brain and central nervous system 
(21% vs 29%), breast (91% vs 93%), liver (21% vs

Cancer stage at diagnosis 
There is a strong correlation between stage  
of disease at diagnosis and survival. 
The Victorian Cancer Registry is undertaking to 
improve the capture of cancer stage at diagnosis 
through a number of projects.  This includes 
expanding the registry-derived cancer stage  
project to other cancer streams and working  
with Health Information Managers and clinicians 
to improve documentation of stage at diagnosis 
in multidisciplinary team meeting software and 
discharge summaries. For each of the five cancers 
for which stage is collected by the Victorian Cancer 
Registry, survival decreased with increasing stage  
of disease at diagnosis (Figure 44).  Diagnosis  Figure 44 : Five-year relative survival for breast,

65of early-stage disease for each of these cancers 
carries an excellent prognosis. A relative survival  
rate exceeding 100% in Stage 1 breast, prostate,  
and melanoma cases implies a superior five-year 
survival rate for this group compared to the broader 
Victorian population of equivalent age and sex.  
This suggests that detection of early-stage cancer 
may be associated with other factors which increase 
survival, such as higher socioeconomic status, 
improved access to medical care and screening tests, 
or improvement in lifestyle after detection of cancer.29

“ I still think about recurrence

‘we’ll know before you do’ ,

George Kiossoglou, living beyond leukaemiaThe likelihood of a person surviving five years 
increases once they have survived a year after 
their diagnosis. 
Victorians are more likely to die in the first year 
following their cancer diagnosis than in subsequent 
years. Among all cancers, survival declines from 100% 
at diagnosis to 85% at year one, and then slows to 
79% at year two, 76% at year three, 73% at year 
four and 71% at year five. This is shown for selected 
cancers in Figure 45.
Conditional survival rates among Victorians

exhibit a 93% probability of survival through 
the subsequent year (Y ear 2). This trend persists, 
as those surviving to the conclusion of Y ear 2 
demonstrate a 96% likelihood of reaching the 
end of Y ear 3. Individuals surviving through Y ear 3 
exhibit a 97% probability of survival to the end of 
Y ear 4. Notably, for those Victorians who survive 
until the conclusion of Y ear 4, there is a 98% 
probability of survival to the end of Y ear 5. This 
sequential analysis underscores the improving 
prospects of survival as individuals surpass 
successive post-diagnosis milestones.
68As a haematologist involved in clinical trials,  
Dr Nora Lee is seeing cutting-edge treatments 
for blood cancers. 
Working with the skilled Bendigo Hospital trials 
unit team, she says patient recruitment to 
haematology clinical trials is challenging for 
many patients.  
“T eletrials are an increasingly important concept 
to at least partially overcome the tyranny of 
distance, ” said Dr Lee. “We have served as a 
successful satellite teletrial site for Peter Mac, 
with published results.  Our primary objective is 
to expand our local haematology trial portfolio.  
“[We had] another teletrial for myelofibrosis, 
but recruitment was slow, potentially related 
to a combination of a regional setting and an 
uncommon disease. ” 
Promising results have been seen through 
clinical trials Dr Lee is involved in, including  
a young man with mantle cell lymphoma who 
had a suboptimal response to chemotherapy. 
With clinical trial treatment, disease remission 
was achieved, enabling him to undergo an 
allogeneic stem cell transplant – his ultimate 
therapeutic goal. 
Dr Lee has also seen significant improvement  
in treating myeloma. “There are numerous 
clinical trials in this space which continues  
to expand, ” she said.   
“Patients who would otherwise not have had 
any further options are still alive because 
they have access to trials. Eventually some of 
these cutting-edge treatments could become 
standard of care. ”  PREVALENCE
A snapshot of cancer prevalence  
in Victoria in 2022 
	An estimated 129,454 Victorians are alive after 
a cancer diagnosis in the past five years, and 
211,930 Victorians are alive after a cancer 
diagnosis in the past 10 years. 
	Over 350,000 Victorians who are alive today, 
have been diagnosed with cancer in the last 
four decades. 
	The proportion of Victorians alive after a cancer 
diagnosis in the previous 5 years has more than 
doubled in the last 35 years. 
	The most prevalent cancer for Victorian men 
aged 50 and over is prostate cancer.  
	The most prevalent cancer for Victorian women 
aged 50 and over is breast cancer.  
Cancer prevalence measures the number of people 
living with cancer (including in remission). It is 
calculated by assessing the number of people alive  on a certain date (index date) and diagnosed with 
cancer within a specified previous number of years.  
Cancer prevalence reflects the relationship between 
cancer incidence and survival and is impacted by 
the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis and the 
effectiveness of available treatments. 
The impact of cancer extends well beyond the 
diagnostic and treatment period. Sequalae of a cancer 
diagnosis include physical consequences of treatments 
(e.g. pain, loss of function peripheral neuropathy, 
lymphoedema, metabolic syndrome), psychosocial 
impact (e.g. anxiety and depression, cancer-related 
fatigue, fear of recurrence, altered sleep and cognition, 
effects on sex and intimacy) and may include financial 
issues – all of which are likely to impact on quality of life 
in the medium and longer term.30 Trends in prevalence 
therefore enables forecasting of healthcare costs and 
services to ensure that the complex needs of Victorian 
cancer survivors are met. In this report, we examine the 
prevalence of Victorians diagnosed with cancer after 
the registry achieved population coverage in 1982.

Figure 46: Trend in percentage of males and females alive and diagnosed with cancer in the past five years, 
from 1 January 1988 to 1 January 2023, Victoria On 1 January 2023, 1.9% of the Victorian 
population was living with cancer which was 
diagnosed in the previous five years. The prevalence 
of cancer is higher in the older age groups, with 
6.3% of Victorians aged 60 years and over, 7.6% 
of Victorians aged 70 years and over, and 7.6% of 
Victorians aged 80 years and over having a cancer 
diagnosed in the past five years.  
The percent of the Victorian community living with 
cancer after a diagnosis in the previous five years has 
increased in all age groups over the last 40 years but is 
most pronounced in older Victorians (Figure 46). It has 
increased from 4.8% to 7.6% in those aged 80 years 
and over, from 4.1% to 7.6% in those aged between 
70-79 years, from 2.7% to 4.8% in those aged 60-69 
years, and from 0.5% to 0.7% in those aged under 50 
years respectively from the index dates of 1 January 
1988 to 1 January 2023.   
The number of Victorians 50 years and 
over living with or beyond cancer who were 
diagnosed in the past five years, has almost 
quadrupled in the last 40 years. 
Approximately 351,756 Victorians who are alive today 
have been diagnosed with cancer within the 40-year 
period since 1983.  
When examining prevalence of Victorians aged 50 
years and over with a history of cancer diagnosed in 
the previous five years, on 1 January 1988 there were 
13,945 Victorian males (2.9% of Victorian males aged 
50 years and over) and 14,548 Victorian females (2.6% 
of Victorian females aged 50 years and over) (Figure

Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer  
in men aged 50 and over. 
As of 1 January 2023, there were 26,096 Victorian 
males who had been diagnosed with prostate  
cancer in the previous five years. This equates  
to approximately 2% of Victorian males aged  
50 years and over having a prostate cancer diagnosis  
in the previous five years. The high incidence rates 
and excellent longer-term survival rates among  
men with early-stage prostate cancer mean that  
it is by far the most prevalent cancer in Victorian  
men aged 50 years and over. Prostate cancer is 
nearly four times as prevalent in males aged 50 years 
and over than bowel cancer (n=6,663), which is the 
next most prevalent cancer (Figure 48). Prostate 
cancer remains the most prevalent cancer in males

aged 50 years and over than any other cancer. As of 
1 January 2023, there were 18,146 females aged 50 
years and over who had been diagnosed with breast 
cancer in the previous five years (Figure 48). Bowel 
cancer is the next most prevalent cancer impacting 
women aged 50 years and over. Breast cancer remains 
the most prevalent cancer in those aged over 70 and 
over 80 years.   
Lung cancer prevalence reflects a poor 
prognosis.  
Even though lung cancer is one of the most commonly 
diagnosed cancers for males and females, because 
of its poor median survival rate (1-year relative 
survival of 50% in males and 59% in females), it 
has a low prevalence compared to other common 
cancers with higher relative survival rates (Figure 
48).  Lung cancer screening and new therapies such 
as immunotherapies are both strategies aimed at 
improving survival and therefore increasing prevalence 
of lung cancer five years after a diagnosis.    About 1 in 3 males and 1 in 4 females aged  
80 years and over have been diagnosed with 
cancer at some time in the last 40 years.  
Cancer becomes increasingly prevalent as Victorians 
age, with rates among those aged 60-69 years more 
than twice as high as those aged 50-59 years (Figure 
49). In Victoria, approximately 27% of Victorians aged 
80 years and over (33% of males aged 80 years and 
over and 23% of females aged 80 years and over) have 
been diagnosed with cancer in the last 40 years and 
are still alive today. About 90% of all cancer survivors 
are aged 50 years and above, 76% are aged 60 years 
and above, 53% are aged 70 years and above, and 
22% are aged 80 years and above.

Classifying Blood Cancers 
Blood cancers, also known as haematological cancers, 
refer to a diverse group of disorders which originate in 
blood cell forming organs of the body.  
Blood cancers are classified according to their 
appearance under the microscope (morphology), 
the organs they usually affect, their cell of origin 
(phenotype), genetic and molecular characteristics, and history of prior cancer or cytotoxic therapy.  
There are more than 200 sub-categories of blood 
cancers classified by the World Health Organization, 
the vast majority of which are defined as rare cancers, 
because there are an average six or fewer new cases 
occurring per 100,000 persons each year or 100,000 
person-years.  
Broadly, there are (1) lymphoid blood cancers, 
which can be either immature (acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia) or mature (lymphoma); (2) myeloid 
blood cancers, which can be either immature (acute 
myeloid leukaemia) or mature (myeloproliferative 
disorder); and (3) other blood cancers, spanning a 
diverse and broad spectrum of diseases beyond those 
encompassed by the broad terms lymphoid and 
myeloid cancer. 
In this Focus report, we provide summary statistics 
on some of the more commonly diagnosed 
blood cancers, categorising them according to 
whether they originate from myeloid or lymphoid 
lineage cells. The International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Problems-
10th edition Australian modified edition (ICD-
10AM)31 classifies blood cancers in such a way 
that diverse morphologies are amalgamated 
within the classification, leading to the grouping 
of heterogeneous blood cancers under a single 
category. This section applies morphology codes 
from the International Classification of Diseases for 
Oncology-3rd edition,32 to the ICD-10AM codes to 
allow a more nuanced understanding and reporting 
of blood cancers. This approach has recently been 
used in the reporting of blood cancer incidence and 
survival by the Australian Institute of Health and 
Welfare (AIHW).34 A summary of acronyms used in 
this report is shown in T able 5.

In 2022, 4,566 Victorians were diagnosed with blood 
cancers, at an age-standardised incidence rate of 38 
cases per 100,000. Blood cancers accounted for 13% 
of the estimated 36,299 new cancer diagnoses in 
Victoria in 2022.  
The most commonly diagnosed blood cancers 
diagnosed between 2018 and 2022 were lymphoid (B,

something really exciting, it can be 
really rewarding to see that. ”
Dr Omer Gilan and his team are “looking under 
the hood” of leukaemia cells by exploring the 
epigenetic landscape to develop new targeted 
therapy options for leukaemia patients.    
Studying why cancer cells are able to “hijack 
the epigenome to drive the formation of 
cancer” , he and his team are looking at ways 
to exploit this knowledge to target cancer cells 
more effectively and predict how cells become 
resistant to therapy. 
“Only recently we discovered there’s this protein, 
called ‘menin’ , that is needed by a very aggressive 
type of leukaemia. It was just by tinkering with 
the cells and understanding how they are kept 
alive that this therapy, called a ‘menin inhibitor’ , 
was able to be developed” says Dr Gilan. 
By temporarily switching off menin, the team has 
found that the leukaemia cells stop proliferating. 
Early tests have indicated that not only does this 
therapy take the “foot of the accelerator” , “it’s 
also hitting the brakes on the [cancer] cells and 
from which they cannot recover” . 
“This therapy restores the normal trajectory of 
the cells. By restoring that normal trajectory 
you’re basically eliminating the leukaemia 
cells by sending them back to what they were 
supposed to be doing, ” says Dr Gilan. 
T argeting menin effectively kills aggressive 
leukaemia cells, prompting therapies that 
are currently in clinical trials. By interrogating 
epigenetic proteins that may cooperate with 
menin to prevent drug resistance, Dr Gilan is 
discovering new ways of treating patients with 
aggressive leukaemia. Dr Omer Gilan, Laboratory Head at Monash

Figure 53: Distribution (%) of new diagnoses of the selected major blood cancer types (and other) by age group, 
Victoria 2013-2022 (n: Absolute number).  More males are diagnosed with blood cancers 
than females. 
In 2022, of those Victorians diagnosed with blood 
cancers, there were 2,636 (58%) males and 1,930 
(42%) females. This equates to an age-standardised 
rate of 46 cases per 100,000 in males and 31 cases 
per 100,000 in females. There are notable differences 
in blood cancer incidence by sex according to the 
different sub-categories, as discussed in the various 
sections of this Focus.  
Blood cancer age-standardised incidence rates 
have been increasing at 1% annually until 2020 
as age-standardised mortality declines by more 
than 2% annually. 
Blood cancer age-standardised incidence rates 
showed a steady increase from 2005 to 2020, with an 
average annual change of +1% (95% CI: 0.6%, 1.4%). 
Between 2020 and 2022, a decline of -4.8% (95% CI: 
-11.4%, 2.2%) occurred, although this change is not 
statistically significant.  
Over the past 15 years (2007-2022), mortality 
from blood cancers has declined steadily, at an 
average annual percent change in age-standardised mortality rate of -2.2% (95% CI: -2.5%, -1.8%).  
The decline is seen more among females than  
males with an annual percent change of -2.4%  
(95% CI -3, -1.8%) in females and -2% (95% CI 
-2.3%, -1.6%) in males.  
Distribution of the blood cancer subtypes varies 
according to age. 
Blood cancers show distinct patterns across age 
groups (Figure 53). Some blood cancers are more 
commonly diagnosed in young people, while others 
are more common in older age groups.  
The most common blood cancers among 
Victorians aged below 30 years is ALL and HL.  
T ogether ALL and HL account for 66% of blood 
cancers diagnosed in Victorians aged under 30 years 
in 2022. Figure 53 indicates that between 2013 and 
2022 among infants and young children under the 
age of five, ALL was the most frequently diagnosed 
type among the total 423 cancers in that age 
category. Among Victorians aged 15-34 years, HL was 
the most commonly diagnosed blood cancer. Among 
Victorians over 75, the most common blood cancers 
were plasma cell neoplasia, MDS and CLL.

Victorians aged over 30 years are PCM, DLBCL, 
MDS, and CLL. 
T ogether PCM (15%), DLBCL (13%), MDS (10%) 
and CLL (13%) account for half of all blood cancers 
diagnosed in Victorians aged over 30 years in 2022.   
Five-year survival for Victorians continues to 
improve for all blood cancers.  
The prognosis after a diagnosis of blood cancer 
varies according to its subtype, with five-year survival 
ranging from 30% to 93%. Figure 54 describes the 
trend in five-year survival over three time periods: 
1982-1986, 1997-2001, and 2017-2021. It shows 
that for all blood cancers, five-year survival over this 
35-year period has improved. Between time period 1 
and 2, the most remarkable improvement in survival 
was seen for CML, demonstrating the impact of BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA
targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
During the most recent time period, significant 
improvement is seen in five-year survival for Victorians 
diagnosed with PCM. FL has the highest five-year 
relative survival, reaching 93.5%. Despite a 97% 
increase in five-year survival over the past 30 years, 
AML has the lowest five-year survival of all blood 
cancers at 29.9% (Figure 54). 
Nearly 18,000 Victorians are living with a blood 
cancer diagnosed in the past five years. 
As of 1 January 2023, there were 17,928 Victorians 
living with or beyond a blood cancer diagnosed in the 
last five years. This includes 10,103 males (56%) and 
7,825 (44%) females. In total, 0.7% of the Victorian 
population have been diagnosed with a blood cancer 
in the last 40 years (from 1 January 1983) and were 
alive on 1 January 2023.  Commonly Diagnosed Blood Cancers
1. Myeloid Blood Cancers
Myeloid blood cancers affect cells in the bone marrow 
and blood. They originate in the myeloid cells, which 
are responsible for producing granulocytic and related 
cells. The main myeloid blood cancers include AML, 
MDS, and MPNs, including CML. Myeloid cancers 
account for 28% of all blood cancers.  
Acute Myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
AML is an aggressive cancer that resemble immature 
myeloid cells in the bone marrow, disrupting the 
production of normal bone marrow, which normally 
generates red blood cells, platelets, and normal 
white blood cells that circulate in the peripheral 
blood. Patients affected with AML have severely 
suppressed red blood cells, platelets, and white blood 
cells (neutrophils) in the peripheral blood. The last 
few years have seen major breakthroughs in how 
the disease is understood and managed. There 
are multiple distinct subtypes of AML categorised 
according to their morphology, immunophenotype 
and genetic profile.32  
Treatment of AML may include intensive 
chemotherapy, newer targeted therapies, as well as 
stem cell transplantation. New therapies included on 
the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in the last 
five years include midostaurin and gilteritinib (FL T3 
inhibitors), gemtuzumab ozogomycin (CD33 targeting 
antibody conjugate), venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) and 
oral azacitidine (hypomethylating agent).  
AML can arise without a prior blood cancer history 
(de novo) or may result from transformation of 
a prior myeloid blood cancer (secondary) or may 
also develop as a result of prior radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy for another cancer (therapy-related 
AML or “AML post cytotoxic therapy”). A summary  
of the blood cancers which have transformed to AML 
is shown in Figure 55.

Incidence and mortality: AML is a blood cancer 
associated with increasing age. Between 1982 
and 2022, 7,873 Victorians have been diagnosed 
with AML. In 2022, the median age at diagnosis 
of AML was 71 years (IQR: 59-79 years). The age-
standardised incidence rate of AML in 2022 was  
2.6 cases per 100,000. In Victoria in 2022, 178 males 
and 131 females were diagnosed with AML, with  
an age-standardised incidence rate of 2.9 and  
2.4 cases per 100,000 respectively. The trend  
in AML crude incidence since 1982 is shown  
in Figure 56A. Since 1982, the annual percent 
change in AML age-standardised incidence rate  
is +0.5% (95% CI: 0.2, 0.7).  
In 2022, 166 Victorians died from AML (100 males,  
66 females) at an age-standardised mortality rate  
of 1 death per 100,000. Since 2008, the crude 
mortality rate has fallen (Figure 56B). Between 2007-
2014 mortality declined at an average annual rate  
of 0.7% (95% CI: -4.1%, 2.9%), although this change  
is not statistically significant. A significant reduction  
in annual mortality has been seen between 2014-
2018 (-14.7% [95% CI: -26.1%, -1.6%]), with a 
stabilising in mortality over the last four years.  
Survival and prevalence: Trends in five-year survival 
by age groups is shown in Figure 56C. Relative survival 
in the period 2017-2021 varies from 10% (95% CI: 
8%, 13%) in those aged over 70 years to 62% (95% CI: 
57%, 66%) in those aged under 60 years. One-year 
relative survival for AML cases transformed from MDS 80 81is 20.6% (95% CI: 15.1%, 26.2%), and from CMML  
or MDS/MPN is 30.5% (95% CI: 20.0%, 40.1%).  
Three-year relative survival for AML cases transformed 
from MDS is 7.5% (95% CI: 3.5%, 11.5%), and from 
CMML or MDS/MPN is 18.6% (95% CI: 9.1%, 28.1%). 
Survival estimates for those transforming from MPN 
and NHL to AML cannot be reliably calculated due  
to low numbers involved.  
Improved survival likely reflects advances in supportive 
care, earlier diagnosis, improvements in therapeutic 
options and improvements in haemopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. Significant advances have also been BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
MDS, also referred to as myelodysplasia, are blood 
cancers that affect the production and function of 
normal blood cells that are usually produced in the 
bone marrow. This can lead to a decreased number 
of red blood cells (causing anaemia), white blood 
cells (causing leukopenia with increased risk of 
infection) and platelets (causing thrombocytopenia 
with increased risk of bleeding). There are several 
subtypes of MDS that can be classified depending 
on the morphology, genetics, blood count deficiency 
and proportion of immature “blast” cells in the bone 
marrow. Because of changes to the classification of 
MDS, incidence data is only reported for the period 
2000-2022 and mortality data from 2008.  
Incidence and mortality: MDS, like AML, is a blood 
cancer associated with increasing age. Between 2000 
and 2022, 8,167 Victorians have been diagnosed with 
MDS. In 2022, 425 Victorians were diagnosed with 
MDS at an age-standardised incidence rate of 2.6 
cases per 100,000. The median age at diagnosis of 
MDS is 77 years (range 5-101 years, IQR: 70-84 years). 
MDS disproportionately affects males. In Victoria in 
2022, 259 males and 166 females were diagnosed 
with MDS, with an age-standardised incidence rate 
of 3.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 respectively. Trend 
in MDS crude incidence since 2000 is shown in Figure 
57A. Between 2007-2014, there has been a decline  
in the age-standardised rate, with an annual 
percentage change of -4.5% (95% CI: -7.1%, -1.9%),

enabling patient access to more targeted treatment 
approaches (e.g. FL T3 inhibitors). Increased availability 
of clinical trial options and improved monitoring  
of residual disease are other notable advances in the 
last decade for patients with AML. 
Five-year prevalence of AML has increased by 68% 
over the past two decades, from 221 people to 593 
people alive five years after a diagnosis of AML.  
There are 274 females and 319 males currently living 
with, or in remission from, AML diagnosed five years 
prior to 31 December 2022 (Figure 56D).

In 2022, 166 Victorians (103 males and 63 females) 
died from MDS at an age-standardised mortality rate 
of 0.8 deaths per 100,000. Since 2008, the MDS crude 
mortality rate has increased among those aged over 
60 years (Figure 57B). The age-standardised mortality 
rate has increased steadily over the period 2009-
2018, with an annual percent change of +13.8%  
(95% CI: 7.7%, 20.3%). Between 2018-2022 mortality 
has stabilised.  
Survival and prevalence: Five-year survival after a 
diagnosis of MDS has improved by 33% over the past 
15 years, from 33% (95% CI: 30-37%) in the period 
2002-2006 to 44% (95% CI: 42%, 47%) in 2017-2021. 
Five-year survival for those aged under 60 years is 
now at 71% (95% CI: 64%, 78%) (Figure 57C). Survival 
decreases for patients with MDS transformed to AML. 
As with AML, improving survival likely reflects earlier 
diagnosis, and improved management of cytopenia 
and supportive care. 
Five-year prevalence of MDS has increased by 22% 
over the past decade, from 1,060 to 1,297 Victorians 
alive five years after a diagnosis of MDS. There are  
777 males and 520 females currently living with,  
or in remission from, MDS diagnosed five years prior  
to 31 December 2022 (Figure 57D).

MPNs are a heterogeneous group of myeloid blood 
cancers characterised by the abnormal proliferation 
of one or more types of blood cells, including red 
blood cells, white blood cells, platelets or bone 
marrow stroma. This overproduction of cells can 
lead to various complications and symptoms. CML, 
polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia 
(ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are the four 
classic types of myeloproliferative neoplasms. From 
1982 to 2022, there have been 3,078 diagnoses 
of CML, 2,797 diagnoses of PV, 2,298 diagnoses of 
ET and 1,558 diagnoses of PMF among Victorians. 
While our primary emphasis in this Focus is on CML, 
comprehensive details regarding other MPNs can be 
requested from the Victorian Cancer Registry.  
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)
CML is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm and 
is a slow-progressing form of blood cancer that affects 
myeloid cells. CML is characterised by the Philadelphia 
chromosome, that juxtaposes the BCR  and ABL1 genes 
to form BCR ::ABL1 gene fusion. This fusion, in turn, 
triggers an overproduction of mature white blood cells 
originating from the bone marrow. It is considered a 
rare blood cancer.  
Incidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022, 
there were 3,078 Victorians diagnosed with CML.  
The median age at diagnosis of CML is 60 years  
(range 21-97, IQR: 44-72 years). The age-standardised 
incidence rate of CML in 2022 was 0.9 cases per 
100,000. In 2022, 92 Victorians were diagnosed 
with CML (48 males and 44 females), with an age-BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA
standardised incidence rate of 1.0 and 0.9 cases per 
100,000 respectively. Trend in CML crude incidence 
since 1982 is shown in Figure 58A. Since 1982, there 
has been an annual percent change of +0.3% (95% CI: 
-0.1%, 0.7%) in the age-standardised rate of CML.  
In 2022, 13 Victorians died from CML (5 males, 8 
females) at an age-standardised mortality rate of 
0.08 case per 100,000. Since 2008, mortality rates 
have declined at an annual rate of 5.7% (95% CI: 
-8.8%, -2.5%) with crude mortality rates indicating 
that the decline was most evident in Victorians aged 
70 years and over (Figure 58B).  
Survival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, 
there has been a 126% increase in five-year survival, 
from 38% (95% CI: 25%, 52%) in 1982-1986 to 87% 
(95% CI: 83%, 91%) in 2017-2021. Five-year survival 
in the period 2017-2021 ranges from 63% in those 
aged 70 and above, to 95% in those aged under 
60 years at diagnosis (Figure 58C). This significant 
improvement is in large part the result of tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib (Glivec), that 
were developed to specifically target the abnormal 
protein produced by the BCR -ABL1 gene fusion that 
drives CML, which revolutionised therapy for this 
condition. TKIs continue to show remarkable efficacy 
in controlling CML. 
Five-year prevalence of CML has doubled over the 
past two decades, from 225 to 454 Victorians alive 
five years after a diagnosis of CML. There are currently  
254 males and 200 females currently living with,  
or in remission from, CML diagnosed five years prior  
to 31 December 2022 (Figure 58D). 2. Plasma Cell Myelomas (PCM) 
including Multiple Myeloma (MM)
Plasma cell myelomas (PCMs) are forms of blood 
cancer that arise from the antibody-producing 
plasma cells in the body. The most common form 
of PCM is multiple myeloma, a chronic blood cancer 
caused by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, 
that can weaken bones, affect production of red cells, 
elevate calcium levels and cause problems in other 
body organs such as the kidney. In Victoria, multiple 
myeloma accounts for 97% of plasma cell myelomas 
diagnosed between 2018 and 2022 (Figure 50).  
Incidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022 
there were 14,229 Victorians diagnosed with PCM. 
PCM is considered one of the more common blood 
cancers, with a crude incidence rate of 9.7 cases per 
100,000 persons. The age-standardised incidence 
rate of PCM in 2022 was 4.5 cases per 100,000.  
The median age at diagnosis of PCM is 73 years 
(range: 35-99 years, IQR: 65-81 years). In Victoria 
in 2022, 641 people (380 males and 261 females) 
were diagnosed with PCM, with an age-standardised 
incidence rate of 5.6 and 3.6 cases per 100,000 
respectively. Figure 59A demonstrates the extent to 
which new diagnoses of PCM have increased over the 
past four decades, particularly among older Victorians. 
The age-standardised incidence rate has increased 
from 2.5 cases per 100,000 persons in 1982 to 4.5 cases 
per 100,000 in 2022, or an average annual percent 
change between 1982-2018 of +2.2% (95% CI: 2%, 
2.5%), with a plateau between 2018-2022.

Male
FemaleIn 2022, 238 Victorians died from PCM (142 males, 
96 females) at an age-standardised mortality rate 
of 1.4 deaths per 100,000. Mortality rates continue 
to decline at a constant rate of 2.7% (95% CI: -3.4%, 
-1.0 %) per year over the past 15 years (2007-2022) 
with the greatest decline seen in Victorians aged 60 to 
69 years, which may reflect the development of newer 
and more effective therapies for treatment of this 
disease (Figure 59B).  
Survival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, 
there has been a 149% increase in five-year survival 
following a diagnosis of PCM, from 26% (95% CI: 
18%, 33%) in 1982-1986 to 64% (95% CI: 62%, 
66%) in 2017-2021. Five-year relative survival 
ranges from 52% in those aged 70 years and above 
to 82% in those aged under 60 years at diagnosis 
(Figure 59C). This has been attributed to more 
effective use of chemotherapy, targeted therapies, 
and immunotherapies. Drugs such as proteasome 
inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies have improved 
response rates and overall survival. 
Five-year prevalence of PCM has increased by 
211% over the past two decades, from 795 to 2,474 
Victorians alive five years after a diagnosis of PCM. 
There are currently 1,453 males and 1,021 females 
living with, or in remission from, PCM diagnosed five 
years prior to 31 December 2022 (Figure 59D).

Blood Cancers
Lymphoid cell blood cancers are cancers that 
originate from the lymphoid cells that are specific 
types of white blood cells. These cancers can arise 
from the bone marrow or other lymphoid tissues  
in the body and can be broadly categorised into 
leukaemias and lymphomas. 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL)
ALL is a blood cancer that affects the bone marrow 
and lymphoid tissues. Historically, subtypes of 
ALL were originally categorised according to their 
morphology, but further sub-categorisation is now 
performed based on the proteins expressed on the 
leukaemia cells (immunophenotype) and genetics. 
ALL can manifest as leukaemia when immature 
leukaemia cells rapidly accumulate in the bone 
marrow that disrupts normal blood cell production, 
or as lymphoma when ALL cells accumulate in lymph 
nodes or other lymphoid tissues, causing swelling  
and potential organ involvement. 
Incidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022 
there were 3,516 Victorians diagnosed with ALL.  
In 2022, there were 69 males and 52 females 
diagnosed with ALL at a crude incidence rate of 1.8 
cases per 100,000 (Figure 60A). The age-standardised 
incidence rate of ALL in 2022 was 2.5 cases per 
100,000. The median age at diagnosis of ALL is 
14 years (range: 0-86 years, IQR: 4-41). There are 
proportionately more males diagnosed with ALL than 
females (2.9 vs 2.1 cases per 100,000 respectively). 
Over the past four decades, the age-standardised 
rate of ALL has shown an average annual percentage 
change of +0.6% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.0%). ALL is the 
most common blood cancer seen among Victorians 
aged less than 15 years (Figure 53).  BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA
In 2022, 28 Victorians died from ALL (10 males,  
18 females) at an age-standardised rate of 0.4 deaths 
per 100,000. Since 2008, the crude mortality rate has 
declined across all age groups (Figure 60B). The age-
standardised mortality rate has declined at a constant 
rate, with the annual percent change of 4.2% (95% CI: 
-7.6%, -0.6%) over the period 2007-2022. The decline in 
mortality was seen mainly in males compared to females 
(-7.6% vs +1% annual percent change) over this period, 
but this was not statistically significant for females.
Survival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, there 
has been a 56% increase in five-year survival after 
diagnosis of ALL, from 50% (95% CI: 40%, 60%) in 
1982-1986 to 78% (95% CI: 74%, 81%) in 2017-2021. 
Notably, five-year relative survival ranges from only 
23% in those aged 60-69 years to 97% for those aged 
under 15 years at diagnosis (Figure 60C). During this 
period, five-year survival among those aged under 15 
years has improved from 67% (95% CI: 54%, 81%) to 
97% (95% CI: 94%, 99%). 
The prevalence of people who have had an ALL 
diagnosis continues to increase as a result of high 
remission rates achieved through advances in 
treatment protocols, including the development 
of more effective chemotherapy regimens and 
development of targeted therapies. Improvements in 
the supportive care for patients undergoing treatment, 
as well as improvements in access and outcomes of 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the 
advent of newer immunotherapies are also likely to 
have contributed to improvement in overall survival. 
There has been a 75% increase in five-year prevalence 
of ALL over the past two decades, from 268 to 469 
Victorians alive five years after a diagnosis of ALL. 
There are currently 278 males and 191 females living 
with, or in remission from, ALL diagnosed five years 
prior to 31 December 2022 (Figure 60D). Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
HL, previously known as Hodgkin’s disease, is a type 
of lymphoma that originates from abnormal B-cells 
and is morphologically characterised by the unique 
appearance of “Reed-Sternberg cells” in lymphoid 
tissue such as lymph nodes that are affected by 
disease. HL generally displays a more predictable 
behaviour and response to treatment than some 
other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). HL 
accounts for approximately 7% of all lymphomas 
and has a bi-modal age distribution. While absolute 
number of cases diagnosed in young people each 
year is low, it is the second most commonly diagnosed 
blood cancer among Victorians aged 0-14 years and 
the most commonly diagnosed blood cancer in those 
aged 15-30 years (Figure 53).  
Incidence and mortality: Between 1982 and  
2022 there were 5,746 Victorians diagnosed  
with HL. The crude incidence rate in 2022 was  
3.3 cases per 100,000 with rates slightly higher 
among older Victorians (Figure 61A). The age-
standardised incidence rate of HL in 2022 was  
3.1 cases per 100,000. The median age at diagnosis 
of HL is 36 years (range: 6-93 years, IQR: 23-61).  
There are proportionately more males diagnosed 
with HL than females. In 2022, 130 males and  
88 females were diagnosed at an age-standardised  
rate of 3.6 and 2.6 cases per 100,000 respectively. 
Since 1982, the age-standardised rate has shown  
an average annual percentage change of +1.2%  
(95% CI: 0.9%, 1.5%).  
In 2022, 19 Victorians died from HL (9 males,  
10 females) at an age-standardised mortality rate 
of 0.1 deaths per 100,000. Mortality rates continue 
to decline at a constant rate, with an annual percent 
change of -5.4% (95% CI: -9.1%, -1.5%) over the

rate by age group is shown in Figure 61B.  
Survival: Five-year survival after a diagnosis of 
HL reached 90% (95% CI: 88%, 92%) for the first 
time in the period 2017-2021. This is an increase 
of 28% from the period 1982-1986, when five-
year survival was 71% (95% CI: 64%, 77%). As 
demonstrated in Figure 61C, patients can live 
following a diagnosis of HL for an extended period, 
particularly if diagnosed at or under 70 years of age. 
For Victorians aged between 15-24 years, five-year 
survival after a diagnosis of HL has reached 99% 
(95% CI: 98%, 101%). Treatment of HL, that often 
includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy, has 
been highly effective, with many patients achieving 
complete remission and cure after treatment. The 
development of combination therapy regimens has 
significantly improved outcomes over time. While 
haemopoietic stem cell transplant has been used 
for patients with poor prognosis diseases, more 
recently, targeted therapies such as Brentuximab 
and immune checkpoint inhibitors have also been 
approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 
HL, further improving survival. 
Over the past two decades, there has been an 87% 
increase in five-year prevalence for people that have 
received a HL diagnosis, from 526 to 986 Victorians 
alive five years after a HL diagnosis. There are 
currently 556 males and 430 females living with,  
or in remission from, HL diagnosed five years prior  
to 31 December 2022 (Figure 61D).

NHL encompasses a diverse group of lymphoid 
cancers with numerous sub-categories of disease. 
This section focuses on two common NHL subtypes 
but, since 1982, Victorians have also been 
diagnosed with other important subtypes of disease: 
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (1,894 cases), Mantle 
Cell lymphoma (1,715 cases), and Burkitt lymphoma 
(485 cases). These subtypes contribute to the overall 
diversity of B-cell lymphomas, each presenting with 
distinct characteristics requiring specific clinical 
considerations.  
‒ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
DLBCL is the most prevalent type of NHL. DLBCL 
accounts for 20% of all lymphomas diagnosed 
between 2018 and 2022. It is a more aggressive form  
of blood cancer characterised by the rapid growth  
of abnormal large B-cells that leads to the formation 
of tumours in lymph nodes and other tissues. While it 
is an aggressive type of NHL, advances in treatments, 
including targeted therapies and in particular 
immunotherapy, have improved the outlook for many 
patients diagnosed with DLBCL.  
As with AML, since 2015, a number of DLBCL cases 
have developed or transformed from other preceding 
blood cancers, with most cases being previously 
diagnosed with another form of NHL (n=497, 99.5%).  
Incidence and mortality: Between 1982 and  
2022 there were 15,313 Victorians diagnosed  
with DLBCL. The median age at diagnosis of DLBCL 
is 71 years (range 14-94, IQR: 60-78 years). The age-
standardised incidence rate of DLBCL in 2022 was 
4.5 cases per 100,000. In 2022, 560 Victorians were 
diagnosed with DLBCL (309 males and 251 females), BLOOD CANCERS IN VICTORIA
with an age-standardised incidence rate of 5.3  
and 3.8 cases per 100,000 respectively. Trend  
in DLBCL crude incidence since 1982 is shown  
in Figure 62A. Between 1982-1993, the age-
standardised incidence rate of DLBCL increased  
with an average annual percent change of 4.1% 
(95% CI: 2.6%, 5.6%). Since then, DLBCL incidence 
has remained stable. 
In 2022, 232 Victorians (129 males and 103 females) 
died from DLBCL, at an age-standardised mortality 
rate of 1.3 deaths per 100,000. Since 2008, there 
has been a modest decline in crude mortality rates 
following a diagnosis of DLBCL with higher rates 
recorded in those aged over 70 years (Figure 62B).  
An annual percent change in age-standardised 
mortality rate of -1.5% (95% CI: -2.2%, -0.7%) has 
been recorded over the period 2007-2022, with similar 
rates of decline among both males and females.  
Survival and prevalence: Five-year survival after  
a diagnosis of DLBCL has doubled over the last  
35 years, from 35% (95% CI: 29%, 42%) in the period 
1982-1985 to 70% (95% CI: 67%, 72%) in the  
most recent period, from 2017-2021. Figure 62C 
shows trend in five-year survival, demonstrating  
a plateauing over the past decade. Of those cases 
diagnosed with DLBCL from a transformed NHL,  
77% (95% CI: 71%, 82%) were alive one-year and 
64% (95% CI: 57%, 71%) were alive three-years after 
this diagnosis. There has been a doubling of five-year 
prevalence for DLBCL over the past two decades, 
with 1,049 to 2,104 Victorians alive five years after  
a diagnosis of DLBCL. There are currently 1,181 
males and 923 females living with, or in remission

“Probably one of the biggest success 
stories in cancer is the ability to cure 
children with leukaemia.
Dr Omer Gilan“88 89– Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) / Small 
Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
CLL and SLL are related forms of indolent NHL that 
are characterised by an accumulation of mature but 
abnormal B-lymphocytes (B cells). CLL affects bone 
marrow and blood, while SLL primarily affects lymph 
nodes and lymphoid tissues. They are considered 
different expressions of the same disease, and 
management is often based on the predominant 
location of disease. In this section they have been 
combined and referred to as CLL. CLL is considered  
a disease of ageing.  
Incidence and mortality: Between 1982 and 2022 
there were 13,342 Victorians diagnosed with CLL. 
The median age at diagnosis of CLL is 71 years 
(range 32-98 years, IQR: 63-69 years). The age-
standardised incidence rate of CLL in 2022 was 
4.0 cases per 100,000. The sharp increase in crude 
incidence of CLL between 2014 and 2018 is artificial, 
reflecting increased detection of CLL by the Victorian 
Cancer Registry following introduction of E-Path, 
a system which automated notification of cancers 
from pathology laboratories (Figure 64A). The crude 
incidence rate in 2022 was 8.2 cases per 100,000. 
There are proportionately more males diagnosed 
with CLL than females. Of those diagnosed with CLL 
in 2022, there were 355 (66%) males and 186 (35%) 
females, at an age-standardised rate of 5.6 and 2.7 
cases per 100,000 respectively. After an initial annual 
increase of 3.3% in age-standardised incidence 
between 1982-1996, incidence rates have stabilised. 
An annual percent change of +12.6% (95% CI: 6.7%, 18.9%) between 2012-2017 was followed by an 
annual percent change of -7.8% (95% CI: -10.8%, 
-4.5%) between 2017-2022.  
In 2022, 102 Victorians (62 males, 40 females) died 
from CLL at an age-standardised mortality rate of 0.5 
deaths per 100,000. The age-standardised mortality 
rate following a diagnosis of CLL has declined from  
1.0 deaths per 100,000 in 2007, equating to an 
average percent change of -4.6% (95% CI: -6.3%, 
-2.8%) between 2007-2022. This decline is seen 
mainly in Victorians aged over 70 years (Figure 64B). 
However, the results should be interpreted with 
caution, given the large increase in notifications  
in 2014 of cases which, in previous years were likely 
not reported to the Victorian Cancer Registry.  
Survival and prevalence: Over the past 35 years, 
five-year survival has improved across all age groups 
(Figure 64C). It has increased 42%, from 63% (95% CI: 
54%, 72%) in 1982-1986 to 90% (95% CI: 88%, 91%) 
in 2017-2021. The steep incline in prevalence seen 
between 2012-2017 reflects the dramatic increase  
in CLL incidence in cases which are likely to have had  
a delayed notification to the VCR. 
Five-year prevalence of CLL has increased by 144% 
over the past 20 years, from 1,046 to 2,548 Victorians 
alive five years after a diagnosis of CLL. For every three 
males living with CLL, there are two females currently 
living with the disease. There were 1,615 males and 
933 females living with, or in remission from, CLL who 
were diagnosed five years prior to 31 December 2022 
(Figure 64D).

Male
Female‒ Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
FL is a slow-growing and less aggressive form of NHL 
compared to DLBCL, that arises from B-cells in the 
lymphoid system. It is generally first identified by 
abnormal lymph node enlargement and, occasionally, 
involvement of the bone marrow.  
Incidence and mortality: Increasingly, FL is one of the 
more commonly diagnosed blood cancers. Between 
1982 and 2022 there have been 8,708 Victorians 
diagnosed with FL. The median age at diagnosis of FL 
is 66 years (range 32-94 years, IQR: 55-74 years). The 
age-standardised incidence rate of FL in 2022 was 3.0 
cases per 100,000. The crude incidence rate of FL is 
increasing across all age groups shown in Figure 63A, 
and in 2022 was 5.4 cases per 100,00 in males and 
4.7 cases per 100,000 females. The age-standardised 
incidence rate is marginally higher in males compared 
to females (3.4 vs 2.7 cases per 100,000 respectively). 
Age-standardised incidence rates have shown an 
average annual percentage change of 2.6% between 
1982-2004 and has, since then, remained stable.  
In 2022, 54 Victorians (34 males, 20 females) died 
from FL at an age-standardised mortality rate of 0.3

five-year survival by age groups; and (D) five-year prevalence among males and females. deaths per 100,000. Mortality rates over the past 14 
years declined rapidly between 2007-2015 (annual 
percent change of -8.8% [95% CI: -14.2%, -3%]) 
and have stabilised in the most recent period from 
2015-2022 (annual percent change of +1.7% [95% CI: 
-5.2%, 9.2%]) (Figure 63B). 
Survival and prevalence: Five-year survival after a 
diagnosis of FL has increased 36% over the past 35 
years, from 69% (95% CI: 59%, 79%) in the period 
1982-1986 to 93% (95% CI: 91%, 95%) in the most 
recent period of 2017-2021. Survival improvement 
has been seen across all age groups (Figure 63C).  
While this may reflect identification of patients  
with earlier stage disease with improved diagnosis,  
the development of newer immunotherapy  
and therapeutic approaches will have contributed  
to the increase in overall survival. 
Five-year prevalence of patients with a FL diagnosis 
has almost doubled over the past two decades, 
from 809 to 1,582 Victorians alive five years after a 
diagnosis of FL. There are currently 806 males and 776 
females living with, or in remission from, FL diagnosed 
five years prior to 31 December 2022 (Figure 63D).

ABOUT THE VICTORIAN  
CANCER REGISTRY
The goal of the Victorian Cancer Registry is to 
collect complete and accurate data on all Victorians 
diagnosed with cancer. This data is used to describe 
trends in cancer incidence, mortality, stage of 
disease at diagnosis, and survival. It also provides 
a tool to identify changes and variation in patterns 
of cancer among subgroups defined by geography, 
demography, and social characteristics. Made 
available to government, researchers and the wider 
community, our data is continually being used to 
guide cancer prevention and control interventions to 
improve cancer outcomes for Victorians.    
Data collection began from six public hospitals in 
Melbourne on 1 January 1940. The registry grew 
rapidly following introduction of the Cancer (Cancer 
Reporting) Act 1980, which mandated all hospitals 
and pathology laboratories to report any patient 
with cancer.34  By 1982, the Victorian Cancer 
Registry became a population-based cancer registry 
recording all Victorians diagnosed and living with 
cancer.     
The Improving Cancer Outcomes Act 2014 (the Act) 
established a modern, flexible, and principle-based 
legislative framework that provides for the collection, 
use and disclosure of cancer and cancer screening 
information.35  
The Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis 
Reporting) Regulations 2015 accompany the Act 
and prescribe the types of cancer - or precursors to 
cancer - to be reported, services that must notify, 
and the timeframe in which a report must be made.36 
Cancer registration    
The data collected by the Victorian Cancer Registry is 
specified in User Guide: Cancer Registration Submission to 
the Victorian Cancer Registry  The User Guide states that 
all melanoma skin cancers must be reported to the 
Victorian Cancer Registry. In terms of non-melanoma 
skin cancers, all in situ and malignant other skin 
cancers (e.g. Merkel cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma) 
of any site must be registered with the Victorian 
Cancer Registry, but only certain squamous cell 
carcinomas (SCC) must be registered.  Less common 
non-melanoma skin cancers are registered as 
“other skin cancers. ” The registry also registers some 
selected uncertain behaviour tumours of the central 
nervous system (CNS) and brain, ovary, urinary tract 
and haemopoietic system, and benign CNS tumours. 
These are not routinely reported in our publications.     The cancer registration process is described in 
Figure 65. In 2022, the Victorian Cancer Registry 
implemented the Rapid Case Ascertainment 
(RCA) module of the E-Path plus software to flag 
cancer pathology registrations meeting particular 
parameters set by three designated clinical trials. 
The aim of the project was to improve the timeliness 
of identifying Victorians eligible for clinical trials 
based on their cancer type and genetic markers.  
The study was finalised in October 2023, and results 
will be published in 2024.  
Cancer notifiers   
The Victorian Cancer Registry is notified of patients 
with cancer by day procedure centres, hospitals 
(denominational, privately-owned, and public), 
public health services, radiation therapy centres, 
pathology services and prescribed registries.    
The Victorian Cancer Registry receives notifications 
of cancer from 262 hospitals, 11 radiation therapy 
centres, BreastScreen Victoria and 26 pathology 
laboratories. The Improving Cancer Outcomes 
(Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 201536 state that 
a cancer must be reported by hospitals within 60 
days of diagnosis and by pathology services within  
30 days of identifying the cancer, or cancer precursor.    
Our staff work cooperatively with the other seven 
population-based cancer registries across Australia 
to ensure that the registry captures Victorian 
residents who are diagnosed out-of-state.    
Data supplied by the Victorian Registry of Births 
Deaths and Marriages and the National Death Index 
also identifies Victorians who have cancer as a cause 
of death on their death certificate.       
As a quality control measure, BreastScreen data is 
linked with the Victorian Cancer Registry to identify 
cancers diagnosed within screening intervals.     
Capturing cancer incidence   
Cancer notifications are transmitted to the Victorian 
Cancer Registry where they are imported into the 
E-Path Plus software. Most cancer notifications 
(>98%) are received electronically. Pathology reports 
are automatically imported into the software. Once 
imported, notifications are consolidated into a 
medical record and artificial intelligence is used to 
extract data fields from pathology reports. Medical 
coders are responsible for auditing data extracted by 
artificial intelligence software, manually recording Victorian Cancer Registry

additional data from pathology reports, retrieving 
incomplete data, and ensuring that E-Path Plus has 
correctly consolidated notifications into the correct 
tumour type and person record.   
T umours are classified by topography and 
morphology according to the International 
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O), 
approved by the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC)/ World Health Organization 
(WHO) ICD-O Committee in April 2019.32 The ICD-O 
has been used for nearly 35 years to code the site 
(topography) and the histology (morphology) of 
neoplasms, or cancers, usually obtained from a 
pathology report. The morphology code has five 
digits; the first four digits identify the histological 
type and the fifth identifies the behaviour of the 
neoplasm (malignant, in situ, benign, etc.).   
For reporting purposes, the Victorian Cancer Registry 
uses the International Statistical Classification 
of Diseases and Related Health Problems,10th 
revision Australian Modified (ICD-10AM),31 which is 
mapped and derived from ICD-O3 topography and 
morphology codes. Cancers are grouped by ICD-
10AM as shown in T able 6.    
The Victorian Cancer Registry is a dynamic database. 
Despite efforts to ensure that all cancer notifications 
up to 31 December 2022 are received by the reports 
censorship date (14 October 2022), the registry 
will receive a small number of notifications after 
this date. Historically, there may be up to 300 new 
diagnoses identified from late notifications, as well 
as amendments to existing cases because of new 
notifications and updates to tumour morphology or 
date of diagnosis.   
Capturing multiple primary tumours   
Cancer incidence reflects the number of primary 
tumours, rather than the number of people, 
diagnosed with cancer. A person may be diagnosed 
with multiple tumours over their lifetime.    
The Victorian Cancer Registry captures multiple 
primary cancers in the same person according to 
rules developed by the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) and the International 
Association of Cancer Registries (IACR).38 Capturing cancer mortality   
The Victorian Cancer Registry routinely links with 
the National Death Index and the state-based 
death registry to determine whether people who 
have been diagnosed with cancer have died. Medical 
coders refer to rules and guidelines described in the 
International Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems 31 to assist in determining cause of 
death. Data from death certificates is augmented 
with data in the registry to determine the cancer site 
and which tumour was responsible for the person’s 
death.    
Deaths are coded to the 4-digit ICD-10 code if cancer 
is determined by coders to be the underlying cause 
of death, otherwise deaths are coded as non-cancer 
deaths and no further details are collected.    
Prior to 2007, the Victorian Cancer Registry relied 
upon cause of death data from the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics (ABS). In 2007, the Victorian 
Cancer Registry medical coders began determining 
cause of death data for a number of reasons: (1) they 
had more comprehensive data available to them, 
including hospital admission data for recurrent or 
metastatic disease; (2) death certificates available 
to the ABS were often insufficient to precisely code 
haematological malignancies; and (3) delay in 
release of the ABS cause of death data meant that 
it was not available for the previous year at the time 
the Victorian Cancer Registry released its report.    
Data captured by the Victorian 
Cancer Registry   
The registry collects a minimum dataset for each 
tumour (T able 6). Additional prognostic data is 
captured for breast cancer (size, hormone-receptor 
status), prostate (Gleason score), and malignant 
melanoma (Clark’s level and Breslow thickness).     
E-Path Plus software automatically abstracts more 
than 200 data fields from pathology reports (Figure 
65). This software was implemented in September 
2020, with most of these fields still to be validated.   T able 6: Information collected by the Victorian Cancer Registry

at the end of the year. Demographic and tumour data 
is checked for completeness and consistencies.     
Medical coders follow up with notifiers to obtain 
suspected missing or incomplete data.    
The following three indices, defined in Cancer 
Incidence in Five Continents39 are used to assess  
the completeness of cancer data captured  
by population-based cancer registries:    
1. Proportion of cases registered from a death 
certificate only (DCO%): A high DCO% suggests 
incomplete incidence notification, and such 
diagnoses may be less accurate. For DCO cases, the 
date of diagnosis is taken as the date of death if it 
is not mentioned on the certificate.    2. Proportion of cases verified with morphology 
(MV%): A low MV% suggests incomplete 
registration of pathology reports, poorer 
verification of diagnoses and incomplete 
registration of cancers for which this is often  
the only source of notification, such as melanoma. 
The higher the MV% for cancers  
of less accessible sites, like brain and pancreas, the 
greater the confidence that the neoplasm existed 
and was primary rather than metastatic.   
3. Mortality to incidence ratio (M/I%): When the 
quality of the mortality data is good (especially 
in terms of the accuracy of cause of death) and 
incidence and survival are in steady state, the M:I 
ratio is approximated by 1 minus the five-year 
survival probability.

ST A TISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Age-standardised rates   
The Victorian age-standardised rates (ASR) in 
this publication are based on the World Standard 
Population (Cancer Incidence in Five Continents 
Volume 10, 2014, IARC).39 These rates are calculated 
using the direct method 40 by summation of the 
weighted age-specific rates. The standard error  
(SE) of each ASR is given in the tables; a 95% 
confidence interval for the rate can be estimated  
by (rate ± 1.96 SE).   
Annual percent change  
Annual percent change (APC) provides a means of 
describing trends in age-standardised incidence and 
mortality rates over time.  APCs in this report are 
calculated using the joinpoint software (version 4.9.0.0; 
https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/), where a 
“joinpoint” refers to a specific point in a time trend 
where a significant change in the direction or rate 
of the trend occurs. Joinpoint analysis is a statistical 
method used to identify these joinpoints and assess 
whether there are significant changes in trends 
over time.41 Calculated using a log transformation 
approach, it provides a means of characterising 
trends using a consistent scale. The reported annual 
percentage change reflects the ACP of the latest 
period, unless otherwise stated. 
Cancer projections   
Cancer projections are intended as a guide to assist 
in understanding from observed data what future 
rates of cancer are expected to look like in Victoria. 
Importantly, projection estimates should be used with 
caution, as they are influenced by past fluctuations in 
specific cancer rates. This is notable when assessing 
prostate cancer which has shown large fluctuation 
over the past three decades (see Incidence chapter). 
Projection estimates also do not consider any 
uncertainty around the future population estimates. 
Estimates of future population size by age and sex 
were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
(catalogue #3222.0, series B, 2022-2071, released on 
23/11/2023).42 
Cancer projection uses an age-period-cohort 
model with a power link function to project cancer 
incidence and mortality by sex for the next 15 years. 
Statistical analysis was performed using Nordpred 
software package in R version 3.6.3.43 For incidence 
and mortality projections, incidence, mortality, and 
population data were aggregated into 5-year age 
groups and 5-year periods from 1982-2022 for all 
cancers. Projection was based on the last 15, 20, 25 or 30 years depending on a goodness of fit test.   
Cases and deaths for all cancers were projected for 
three 5-year periods (see T ables 2 and 4). For each 
5-year period, projected incidence and mortality 
presented are the annual average for that period. Only 
age groups with at least 10 cases or deaths in total 
were used in the model for projections. Age groups 
with less than 10 cases or deaths were projected as 
the average from the last 10 years.   
T wo different models were run to obtain projections; 
Model 1 used all available data (1982 to 2022), 
whereas Model 2 included only pre-COVID data 
(1982-2019). Since we have seen fewer diagnoses 
than expected, we wanted to create a projection that 
took into account that the ‘missed diagnoses’ will 
present in the future.  
Registry-derived stage (RD-Stage)   
RD Stage was introduced for select cancers in 2014 
to address a deficit in the reporting of cancer stage by 
hospitals. The Victorian Cancer Registry has for some 
years derived stage for selected cancers using data 
available from pathology reports and from hospital 
notifications reporting coded metastatic disease 
sites at diagnosis, augmented by reported stage 
from hospitals and radiotherapy services where this 
is available. The derivation rules were the starting 
point for the national Business Rules developed and 
evaluated in 2015 by the Victorian Cancer Registry as 
a national project under the Cancer Australia Staging, 
Treatment and Recurrence (ST aR) initiative.44   
It is recognised that stage derived using these 
business rules may differ from stage obtained through 
multidisciplinary meetings and by clinicians for use 
in patient management but is the best available 
measure of stage for use at a population level. T o 
clearly distinguish this registry-derived stage from 
that from multi-disciplinary team meetings (MDT) or 
clinicians, the name “Registry-Derived Stage” (or RD-
Stage in short) has been adopted.    
RD-Stage provides a useful tool to examine variation 
in practice across geographic regions, age groups 
and cancer types, and to explore the impact of cancer 
screening on disease presentation.    
Details of the definitions and business rules for RD-
Stage are available on request. These are based on 
TNM 7th Edition for breast and bowel cancers45 and 
TNM 8th Edition for melanoma and endometrial 
cancer.46 Because of significant changes made to 
the staging system for prostate cancer between the 7th and the 8th edition, the International Society of 
Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system47 has been 
used to describe prostate cancer stage in this report. 
As with lower stage, a lower ISUP group indicates 
less invasive disease. Small numbers of tumours with 
morphology not eligible for TNM staging have been 
excluded from RD-Stage calculation.     
Relative survival    
The survival results in this report are relative survival 
estimates. Relative survival is the survival of a person 
with cancer compared with the expected survival 
for a person of the same age and sex in the general 
population, extracted from Victorian specific life 
tables obtained from the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics (ABS; catalogue #3302055001).9  
Survival figures presented in this report are outcomes 
from a “period” survival analysis. Only the most recent 
interval survival estimates for cases diagnosed in 
different calendar years (cross-sectional estimate 
of survival) are used. The estimate of period 5-year 
survival for persons in 2017-2021 uses the 1-year 
interval survival for patients diagnosed in 2020, the 2-year interval survival for patients diagnosed in 2019, 
and so on. Because the “period” method uses only the 
most recent survival experience it provides the most 
up-to-date measure of recent survival.  Period survival 
was calculated using the Ederer II relative survival 
method,48 calculated using the ‘periodR’ package.49 
Using this approach, 56% five-year survival does not 
mean that 56/100 cancer patients are alive five years 
later but 56% (about half) as many of this group 
would survive compared with a group the same age 
and sex from the general population. Thus, the actual 
proportion surviving would differ between age groups 
even if relative survival were the same.    
We show here an example of relative survival for two 
fictional groups of 100 cancer patients aged <30 
and >85 years - based on life tables for the whole 
Victorian population, we would expect to have 95 
and 35 persons of the general population surviving 
after five years. If the relative survival was 56% for 
each group, the number of cancer patients who 
survived would be 56% of 95 =53 persons for the 
younger group and 56% of 35=20 persons for the 
older group. So, the same relative survival proportion 
102 103does not mean the same proportion of deaths in 
the cancer group, but the same excess proportion of 
deaths.   
T o present accurate survival statistics, it is necessary 
to identify deaths occurring in all Australian States 
and T erritories for persons included in the incidence 
data. Many persons resident in Victoria at time of 
diagnosis subsequently move interstate. Notification 
of deaths occurring within Victoria are received 
monthly from the Victorian Registrar of Births, 
Deaths and Marriages, but for deaths in other states, 
it is necessary to link the annual incidence file to 
the National Death Index (NDI); at the Australian 
Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The latest 
linkage to the NDI allows us to include interstate 
deaths that occurred in 2021 for people who were 
residents of Victoria at the time of cancer diagnosis 
but died outside of Victoria.  
Relative survival can be above 100% which indicates 
that survival is better in the group of interest 
compared with the age/sex-matched Victorian 
population. We see this for example in early-stage 
breast and prostate cancer.   
Prevalence 
This report provides person-based limited-duration 
prevalence; that is, the number of people diagnosed 
with cancer within a specific period (e.g., 2 years, 5 
years or 10 years) who were still alive on the index 
date. Eligible cases included in the prevalence counts 
were defined as having: 
 a diagnosis date in between the index date and 
the diagnosis cut-off date, with the diagnosis cut-
off date calculated as the index date minus the 
specific period of interest,  
 no death date, or a death date greater than or 
equal to the index date. 
Ages of eligible cases were calculated from the index 
date and cases with an age greater than 105 years 
were excluded from the dataset as they may have 
migrated overseas and therefore been lost to follow-
up. All age specific calculations were based on the age 
calculated from the index date. 
Population data used to calculate the percentage of 
different portions of the Victorian population living 
with a history of cancer were based on the Victorian 
Estimated Residential Population from ABS as at 1 
year prior to the index date year. APPENDIX 2:  
ST A TISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Statistical modelling to estimate the effect  
of COVID in new diagnoses 
Poisson regression was used to estimate the direction 
and magnitude of trends in incidence for each cancer 
type by age group and sex using pre-COVID data up to 
2019, using the following model with monthly data: 
[Equation]  + interactions(sex x age +  year x sex +  year x age 
+ year x sex x age) +  residual 
where month, sex and age group were categorical 
variables while year was included as a continuous 
variable. The expected number of new diagnoses in 
2020, 2021 and 2022 were estimated by applying this 
model on 2020-2022 population data. The observed 
number of new diagnoses was compared with the 
expected number (and 95% CI) in absolute and 
relative sense. 
For each tumour type, the start of the pre-COVID 
period was defined as the start of the latest period 
during which incidence rates, for males and females, 
did not change. This period was obtained using 
the joinpoint software (version 4.9.0.0; https://
surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/) using all default 
settings.41 When the period differed for males and 
females, the longest common period was used as pre-
COVID period, up to 2019. APPENDIX 3:

USING VCR DAT A  
How we support cancer care  
in Victoria   
The Victorian Government has developed a Victorian 
Cancer Plan 2020-24, which sets an agenda for 
activity aimed at preventing cancer, increasing 
survival, improving cancer treatments and care, and 
achieving equitable outcomes for all Victorians with 
cancer.50 Data from the Victorian Cancer Registry is 
used to assess the progress of the plan in realising 
its goals. It is also used to help plan the delivery of 
cancer care in Victoria. Local hospitals and cancer 
services use our data to help them manage cancer 
service delivery, plan for future cancer needs in their 
community, undertake audit, and deliver quality 
improvement activities.    
How we contribute to cancer research  
in Australia    
We provide cancer data to the Australian Cancer 
Database (ACD), which is hosted by the Australian 
Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The ACD 
collects data from each state and territory in 
Australia, and is a central repository of information 
about primary, malignant cancers. The AIHW uses 
this data to report national cancer incidence, trends, 
projections, survival, and prevalence. These statistics 
help to inform cancer prevention and treatment 
strategies and monitor the impact of policies at a 
national level.     
The AIHW makes the data from the ACD public via its 
website at https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-
data/our-data-collections/australian-cancer-
database/about-australian-cancer-database.  
How we contribute to global research   
We provide de-identified data to the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to contribute 
to global statistics on cancer incidence, prevalence, 
and mortality. This year, we continue to contribute 
de-identified data to IARC’s global effort to better 
understand the impact of COVID-19 on cancer 
incidence, treatments, and outcomes.  We also 
contribute to the International Cancer Benchmarking 
Partnership (ICBP), a partnership which brings together 
clinicians, policymakers, researchers and data experts 
from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New 
Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom 
to measure variation in cancer incidence, mortality, 
survival, stage at diagnosis and survival by stage, and 
factors which might be driving variation.51     Research supported by our data   
We respond to requests for data from government 
agencies, integrated cancer services, community 
services and researchers. Requests are made for 
data to explore disparities in cancer incidence and 
treatment, identify cancer clusters, and support 
quality improvement activities.    
In addition to formal requests lodged for our data, 
it is possible to obtain comprehensive cancer data 
through the publicly available Data Explorer (Figure 
66). The Data Explorer allows people to delve into 
the Victorian cancer data and explore trends in 
incidence, prevalence, and survival over time and 
by sub-groups, such as Integrated Cancer Service, 
Aboriginal and/or T orres Strait Islander status, and 
socio-economic quintile.

on website at https://www.cancervic.org.au/
research/vcr 
In 2022, we serviced 116 data requests and undertook 
59 data linkages. This is a 19% decline on previous 
years, likely due to our data being made more 
accessible and available via the website. Most data 
access requests were submitted by health care 
organisations (51%), followed by researchers (25%), 
Cancer Council requests (13%), state government 
(7%), and community and federal agencies (4%).

108 109The Victorian Cancer Registry receives notifications 
of pre-cancers as well as cancers. While pre-cancers 
are not included in the body of this report, they 
are listed here as they may provide insight into the 
impact of screening, immunisation and public health 
messaging on early detection.    
T able 9 summarises the distribution of in situ 
melanoma and breast cancers and cervical pre-
cancerous abnormalities captured by the Victorian 
Cancer Registry.    
In Victoria, women have access to regular screening 
for breast and cervix cancers through BreastScreen 
Victoria and the National Cervical Screening 
Program. As a result, we expect to see in situ 
incidence increasing as cancers are detected  
earlier. This early detection is expected to be 
accompanied by decreasing numbers of invasive 
cancers over time.    APPENDIX 4:  
IN SITU CANCERS AND DYSPLASIA 
Definition of in situ cancers    
In situ melanomas are abnormal cells that have not 
extended beyond the epidermis into the dermis.     
In situ breast cancers are abnormal cells that have 
not spread outside the ducts or lobules into breast 
tissue. They include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 
lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and other unspecified 
carcinoma of the breast.      
Cervical pre-cancerous abnormalities can develop 
from squamous or glandular cells. Abnormal 
squamous cells are known as low-grade (LSIL) or 
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). 
The registry only receives notification of HSIL or more 
advanced pre-cancerous cells. Abnormal glandular 
cells are known as adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS).  
HSIL and AIS are both caused by the human 
papillomavirus infection and may become invasive 
tumours if left untreated.Age groupCervix Breast Melanoma
